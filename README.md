# devopsdays-web

This is the repo for managing [devopsdays.org](http://www.devopsdays.org).

## Managing your event content

If you are on a local devopsdays team and you'd like to edit [devopsdays.org](http://www.devopsdays.org) for your events, you're in the right place.

Guidelines for contributing event-specific content to this repository are outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you intend to contribute (and we hope you do!), please take a moment to review that document so you can get set up correctly.

When you're ready to add content, instructions and utilities are available for [managing sponsors, events, speakers, and more](utilities/README.md).

## Site-wide Hugo theme

You may find that you want to improve the site in some way that's not specific to your event. We use a custom Hugo theme, and reference documentation is available in [themes/devopsdays-theme/REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web/blob/master/themes/devopsdays-theme/REFERENCE.md).

The technical details for contributing to the site-wide theme's development are covered in [devopsdays-theme's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Reporting issues & feature requests

If you discover an issue with the site that isn't specific to an event's content, please open an issue in the [devopsdays-theme repo](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/issues/new) and prepend the title with `[BUG]`.

If there is a feature that you would like to see, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/issues/new) to the theme repository and prepend the title with `[ENHANCEMENT]`.

If you would like to help prioritize enhancements, please upvote the original issue by [adding a reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).
