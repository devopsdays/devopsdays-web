## Managing your event content

If you are on a local devopsdays team and you'd like to edit [devopsdays.org](http://www.devopsdays.org) for your events, you're in the right place.

Guidelines for contributing event-specific content to this repository are outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you intend to contribute (and we hope you do!), please take a moment to review that document so you can get set up correctly.

When you're ready to add content, instructions and utilities are available for [managing sponsors, events, speakers, and more](utilities/README.md).

### If you have to cancel your event

In the instance where you might need to cancel an event that is already listed on the website, follow [these instructions](utilities/docs/cancel-event.md) to properly update the site.

## Site-wide Hugo theme

You may find that you want to improve the site in some way that's not specific to your event. We use a custom Hugo theme, and reference documentation is available in [devopsdays-theme's reference.md](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web/blob/main/themes/devopsdays-theme/reference.md).

The technical details for contributing to the site-wide theme's development are covered in [devopsdays-theme's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web/blob/main/themes/devopsdays-theme/CONTRIBUTING.md).
