### Empowering Teams in Test Automation

I'm an unyielding automation engineer and consultant, helping development teams start or revive automated testing.

My passion for test automation began during my masterâ€™s thesis, where I discovered the liberating power of unit tests. Since then, I've led testing initiatives in five large-scale projects across automotive, medical, and insurance industries.

I'm also a regular participant in StorySlam Zurich and was a finalist in 2024, developing my skills to connect with audiences of all backgrounds.
