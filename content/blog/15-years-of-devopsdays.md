In 2024, the DevOps community celebrates a significant milestone: the 15th anniversary of DevOpsDays. This event, which has grown into a global phenomenon, is returning to its roots in Antwerp, Belgium, where the original idea was conceived by Patrick Debois and Kris Buytaert. 
The conference began as a humble gathering in Ghent, the site of the first event, but it quickly grew into a worldwide movement, spreading the principles of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement in IT and software development practices to dozens of cities across the globe. Mark your calendars for September 4 and 5, 2024, as these dates promise to
 be a landmark occasion in the DevOps community.  For this celebration we are heading back to the exact venue in the Antwerp Zoo, right next to the fantastic Antwerp Central train station , where Patrick and Kris got the idea, we are really going back to the roots of DevOps. 

Reflecting on the journey from that initial spark in Antwerp to today's expansive network of DevOpsDays events, the 15-year mark is not just a celebration but also a testament to the enduring relevance of DevOps principles. 
Patrick Debois and Kris Buytaert envisioned a space where practitioners could share their experiences, challenges, and solutions, driving the industry towards a culture of shared responsibility and continuous delivery. 
The return to Belgium for this anniversary symbolizes a full-circle moment, honoring the origins of an idea that has since influenced thousands of professionals and numerous organizations worldwide.

As attendees gather in Antwerp, they will not only look back on the achievements of the past decade and a half but also anticipate the future of DevOps. The conference will feature keynotes from industry pioneers, 
including Steve Pereira, Manuel Pais, Michael Ducy, John Willis, Nathen Harvey, Patrick Debois, Mandi Walls, and Paulina Dubas, among many others. These speakers will share their insights and experiences, fostering
 an environment where new ideas can take root and flourish. This 15th anniversary is a celebration of community, collaboration, and the relentless pursuit of excellence that defines DevOps. It is a moment to honor 
the past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future of this ever-evolving discipline, reinforcing the global impact and unity that DevOpsDays continues to promote.

The significance of this event extends beyond mere celebration. It is a unique opportunity for professionals across the spectrum of IT and software development to come together and engage in meaningful conversations. The diversity of attendees, from seasoned DevOps practitioners to newcomers eager to learn, ensures a rich exchange of knowledge and experiences. The eventâ€™s structure, with its blend of formal presentations and
 open space discussions, allows for deep dives into specific topics and spontaneous problem-solving sessions, making it a dynamic and interactive experience.

For anyone involved in the DevOps world, missing this event would be a missed opportunity to be part of a historic gathering. It is a chance to network with industry leaders, gain insights into the latest trends and technologies, and contribute to the ongoing dialogue shaping the future of DevOps. The spirit of DevOpsDays, rooted in collaboration and shared learning, offers unparalleled opportunities for personal and profess
ional growth. As the community celebrates 15 years of progress and innovation, there is no better time to join the conversation and be inspired by the collective knowledge and passion that defines DevOpsDays. Join
