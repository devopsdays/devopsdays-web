Last October, 23-27 2017 we celebrated at Melia Marina Varadero the second 
annual event of DevOpsDays Cuba with participation of more than 120 delegates. 
The event was well received and of great interest to different educational institutions such as: Informatics 
Science University (UCI), Central University (UCLV) and others Universities 
from different regions of the country. In addition, the public sector was 
represented by professionals of companies related to Software Industry 
and Telecommunications services such as: DESOFT, DATYS, GEOCUBA, ETECSA, XETID, etc. 
As a great improvement, this year the event was well received by IT professionals 
of the young private sector in Cuba (TCP).

  All attendees were able to share and experience speakers from Cuba, United States, United Kingdom, France, and Belgium in addition to the conversations that the attendees had with the speakers during Open Spaces. The first day, we covered subjects related with <b>“Cultural and DevOps adoptions”</b>, the event began with extended and engaged discussions of a speaker panel model with the International Speakers. The sessions continued with an [All Day DevOps](https://www.alldaydevops.com/) Watch Party viewing live on-line transmissions of talks selected by attendees votes followed by discussions during Open Spaces.

The other days started with Keynotes, Main Speaker Talks, 
followed by Ignite Talks, and interactive knowledge experience exchange discussions during Open Spaces sessions. The first presentation of the event was by US expert [Randy 
Shoup](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-cuba/speakers/randy-shoup/), 
regarding his experience as it pertains to DevOps adoption in organizations like 
Google, Ebay and  Stitch Fix; and Puerto Rican expert 
[Mike Rosado](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-cuba/program/mike-rosado/) 
closed the event with a workshop that summarized essential elements of DevOps as it relates to delivering business value to the organization, that was well received by the attendees.

In general, the main topics of discussion at the event were: Practices 
and Configuration Management Tools, Docker, Monitoring of resource and 
services, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, DevOps as cultural 
movement in Enterprises, Hiring DevOps professionals, Infrastructure as Code, 
Microservices and legacy app migration, Testing of infrastructure projects, 
experiences building reactive applications, Big Data solutions with DevOps approach, 
and other interesting topics presented during open space discussions that 
propitiated as Win-Win experience for all attendees.

All days of the event we had a single track session for the whole day (9:00 AM - 6:00 PM). It was gratifying to note 
that until late at night, several professionals exchanged experiences on 
other topics of interest due to time restricted reasons which is why they were unable to be present during the scheduled program, such as topics on "Data services in Microservices" by Randy Shoup or on the "Integrating roles of a Cloud Architect in companies" by Lee Fox, or on the creation of IT communities offered by Aymen El Amri.

This year we repeated the tradition of gifting the Cuban speakers with books at the end 
of their talks to help contribute to their professional development, also at 
the end of each day the attendees participated in a raffle of IT books, 
swags, IT certification vouchers, vouchers to VPS services, etc. We are

The final activity planned as Beach Party was suspended by the hotel due 
to bad weather conditions, but that did not stop us and we continued 
with enthusiasm to finish doing an after party at the Hotel Pool, celebrating 
the event success with Salsa music, karaoke, and dance classes. The right person 
to animate the after party event was Lee Fox who was the life of the party with his positive energy and contagious 
enthusiasm [#selfieswithleeshat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/selfieswithleeshat?src=hash).
