[DevOpsDays Seattle 2017](https://devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle) was held at McCaw Hall on April 26th and 27th. Around 400 participants saw a mix of internationally known and local speaker talking about their challenges and successes.

After the end of the event, we sent around a survey. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. You can see the full results [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-SCTVN9PB/).

Some things we think went well:

* The speakers all did a great job. You can watch a recording of each session by clicking on the title on our [program page](/events/2017-seattle/program/).
* Most people said they liked the balance between chosen sessions and open spaces

Some things that could have been better:

* We did an experiment where we asked a couple people who had submitted sessions with too narrow of a focus for the entire audience to do them in the afternoons during open space times. It may have been due to a complex venue layout, but those sessions weren't as well attended as we would have hoped.
* We could have done a better job letting people know where to go for the various open space sessions. As mentioned, the venue had a complex layout and not everyone was able to find the session they wanted to attend.

The Talks
---

As I mentioned above, the speakers all did a great job. I'm sure I shouldn't point out personal high points, but I'm going to anyway...

* A little over 8 years ago I started a new job and was introduced to continuous delivery pipelines by one of my new colleagues at the time, [Jez Humble](/events/2017-seattle/program/jez-humble/). This was before the CD book he co-authored was released, and at the time I didn't realize just how privileged I was to be learning it from him. It was great personally to hear some of the things people have been telling him in the years in between.
* Speaking of learning since a book came out... I also really enjoyed the talk by [Gene Kim](/events/2017-seattle/program/gene-kim/) about the top things he's learned since The Phoenix Project came out.
* I highly recommend you don't watch the talk by [Jeff Smith](/events/2017-seattle/program/jeffery-smith/) in an area where you'll be embarrassed to literally laugh out loud. In an industry where we all want to play with the new shiny thing, Jeff has a great way of reminding us that we might still want to know how our companies do little things like make money.
* [Sarah Shewell and Suzanne Nielsen](/events/2017-seattle/program/sarah-shewell-suzanne-nielsen/) proved that you don't have to travel doing talks for a living to be great at sharing information. I'd love to see more talks from local businesses on their challenges and successes at all events!
* The ignite talk from [Soo Choi](/events/2017-seattle/program/soo-choi/) affected me quite a bit more than I expected it to. Soo gives us a very personal glimpse into what it can be like to be a woman at a technical conference. It's hard for me to type about this without using language I don't want to here, so you can see my more detailed rant [here](https://kenmugrage.com/2017/04/28/stop-making-conferences-shitty-for-other-people/).

The Open Spaces
---

I hate to type this, as open spaces are usually my favorite part of a DevOpsDays event, but I didn't make it to very many. I've heard from many people that they had great discussions, but were hampered somewhat by a confusing layout and background noise. We'll work to make that better next year.

Next Year
---

I'm pretty sure we'll do it again next year, but don't have any details yet. I'd guess it would be roughly the same time frame. It might be the same venue. I think most (if not all) of the organizers will be back.

I know it's gonna be awesome.
