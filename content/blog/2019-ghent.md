It's hard to believe but it is almost 10 years ago since #devopsdays happened for the first time in Gent.
Back then there were almost 70 of us talking about topics that were of interest to both Operations and Development, 
we were exchanging our ideas  and experiences `on how we were improving the quality of software delivery.  

Our ideas got started on the crossroads of Open Source, Agile and early Cloud Adoption. but we decided on not having a manifesto.
10 years later and the word "devops"  is all over our industry. 

This October we are celebrating the 10th year anniversary  of  that conference,  while we only had a small number of events in Ghent, 
it's time to come back to the city where it all started ..  Back to Ghent.
