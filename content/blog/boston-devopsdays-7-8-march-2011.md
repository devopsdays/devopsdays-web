Another year, another devopsdays! This time in the marvelous city of Boston.

**On 7 and 8 March 2011**, we are organizing a new devopsdays. It will be a two event with conference talks in the morning and [openspaces](/pages/open-space-format) in the afternoon.

It is kindly hosted by the [Microsoft NERD Center](/events/2011-boston/location)

You can contribute in one of the following ways:

1. **Propose a session for the conference talks:** it will be a 45 minute session where you can talk about the next big things happening in devops land, you're reflections on devops (good and bad), the experiences you want to share. For a detailed description see [our call for presentations](/events/2011-boston/proposals)
2. **Propose a lightning talk:** If you have a strong devops related message that you really want to share with the DevOps world, we encourage you to send us a proposal for an Ignite presentation. These are 5 minute talks with 20 slides which auto-advance. If you aren't familiar with the format, google is your friend (and I won't question your geek cred... *cough* maybe you've just been busy... [go check some out](http://igniteshow.com), we'll still be here when you get back. ) The only rule is don't give a straight pitch.  That's not even a rule we'll enforce, everyone will just think you are lame... that is punishment enough.
3. **Register and show up:** One of the success factor of previous devopsdays is the [openspace-format](/pages/open-space-format): it fosters the sharing of ideas and insights in good old fashion, non-technical way by just talking to each other. Last time it even got people who would normally never talk, into the conversation. This doesn't require any effort besides [registering](/events/2011-boston/registration) and showing up at the event.
4. **Sponsor the event:** We really like to keep the devopsdays a low budget maximum pleasure thing. Therefore we actively seek sponsors to make this happen. In return we hope to [make it valuable for you to sponsor](/events/2011-boston/sponsor).

Hope to meet you at the [devopsdays in Boston](/events/2011-boston/)!

The organizers: Vladimir Vuksan, Adam Fletcher , John Vincent , Patrick Debois
