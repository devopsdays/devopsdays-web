Devopsday USA 2010 will be held in **Mountain View, California on Friday, June 25, 2010**. This event is inspired by and a continuation of the conversation from [Devopsdays Belgium 2009](/events/2009-ghent/program)

As we put together an agenda, we are looking to **YOU** to help shape the event.

The best way to ensure that you get the most out of this event is to make a proposal or suggestion about a topic in which you are interested!

For more details check our [proposal page](/events/2010-us/proposals).
