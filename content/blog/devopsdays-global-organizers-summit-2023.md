This August, the day before [Devopsdays Chicago](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/welcome/), organizers from all over the globe will come together to exchange best practices and connect. 

To celebrate 10 years of Devopsdays, in 2019, co-located with Devopsdays Ghent in Belgium, the first Organizers Summit took place. Devopsdays is a global event series, and there's heaps we can learn from eachother. The pandemic of course meant we couldn't really get together sooner, and we're hoping to see many of you in Chicago, this August 8.   

The [Devopsdays Organizer Summit 2023](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-organizer-summit/welcome/) is your chance to meet other organizers, share ideas, and learn from each other. 

Submit to the **[Call for Papers](https://organizers-summit-proposals.devopsdays.org/organizers-summit-2023/cfp)** until March 1.

(Former / current) Devopsdays organizer? Registration for the event will open soon - the **ticket is a free add-on to registration for Devopsdays Chicago**, taking place August 9 - 10. **Virtual attendance** is available for those who cannot attend in person.  

If you need support with your **Visa application**, we'd be happy to provide you with an invitation letter. Please [fill out your details](https://forms.gle/aTh8jZAHgBcULYs96) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Any questions / suggestions you may have can be directed at Matty Stratton, Yvo van Doorn, or myself. You can find us in the [Devopsdays Slack](devopsdays.slack.com).
