The DevOpsDays community stands with our Ukrainian friends and family. We condemn the actions of Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. We urge all community members to do whatever they can to help Ukraine; whether it be donating money, time, influence, or all of the above.

**There are many ways you can help Ukraine right now.**

*TL;DR - If you’re in the US donate to  Nova Ukraine and Razom for Ukraine which are both 501(c)3 and are commonly found in Employer Match programs. Outside of the US donate via https://supportukrainenow.org and https://helpukrainewin.org/. Raise awareness using #StandWithUkraine on Social Media.*

In our opinion, the best resource to find out how to help in your country is the Support Ukraine Now website (https://supportukrainenow.org/) which lists ways to donate money, provide humanitarian aid, offer shelter, attend rallies, contact politicians/leaders, etc.  Much of this information is taken from there.

Be Informed
===========

There are many sources of information right now, some are better than others.  Where possible try to follow Ukrainian news directly rather than what your local news media is showing as it is more likely to be accurate and detailed.

The following are sources that we trust:

Donate Money
============

As always be wary of scams asking for help, always verify the Charity/Organization/Person is legitimate, there have been many instances already of scams, especially in the crypto space.

If you are in the US you may want to consider donating to one of the 501(c)3 charities. There are a number listed on the websites above but you may want to check if your employer matches donations to them.  Both [Nova Ukraine](https://novaukraine.org/) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://razomforukraine.org/) are commonly found in Employer Match programs and are easy to donate money to.

World Central Kitchen is providing hot meals to Ukrainians as they cross the border into Poland and other neighboring countries. They are also helping kitchens provide meals in Lviv and Odessa.  You can donate to them [here](https://t.co/dRJJgnlcKt).

There are many Humanitarian and Support Charities.  For comprehensive lists across many countries, you can visit [https://supportukrainenow.org](https://supportukrainenow.org/) and <https://helpukrainewin.org/>.

If you feel comfortable doing so you can donate directly to the Ukrainian Army from anywhere in the world via the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi) or [Monobank](https://uahelp.monobank.ua/).

============

Be wary of sharing unverified content. The usual misinformation is flying around.  Look for multiple trusted sources sharing information before sharing it yourself.
