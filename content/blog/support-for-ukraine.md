The DevOpsDays community stands with our [Ukrainian community members](https://twitter.com/days_dev), friends and family. We condemn the actions of Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. We urge all community members to do whatever they can to help Ukraine; whether it be donating money, time, influence, or all of the above.

**There are many ways you can help Ukraine right now.**

*TL;DR - If you’re in the US donate to [Nova Ukraine](https://novaukraine.org/donate/) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://razomforukraine.org/donate/) which are both 501(c)3 and are commonly found in Employer Match programs. Outside of the US donation options can be found at https://supportukrainenow.org and https://helpukrainewin.org/. Raise awareness using #StandWithUkraine on Social Media.*

In our opinion, the best resource to find out how to help in your country is the Support Ukraine Now website (https://supportukrainenow.org/) which lists ways to donate money, provide humanitarian aid, offer shelter, attend rallies, contact politicians/leaders, etc.  Much of the information found below is taken from there.

Special thanks to the [DevOpsDays Kyiv](https://twitter.com/days_dev) team who provided many of the resources and details found below.

Be Informed
===========

There are many sources of information right now; some are better than others.  Where possible try to follow Ukrainian news directly rather than what your local news media is showing as it is more likely to be accurate and detailed.

Donate Money
============

As always be wary of scams asking for help, always verify the Charity/Organization/Person is legitimate; there have been many instances already of scams, especially in the crypto space.

If you are in the US you may want to consider donating to one of the 501(c)3 charities. There are a number listed on the websites above but you may want to check if your employer matches donations to them.  Both [Nova Ukraine](https://novaukraine.org/donate) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://razomforukraine.org/donate) are commonly found in Employer Match programs and are easy to donate money to.

World Central Kitchen is providing hot meals to Ukrainians as they cross the border into Poland and other neighboring countries. They are also helping kitchens provide meals in Lviv and Odessa.  You can donate to them [here](http://wck.org/relief/activation-chefs-for-ukraine).

There are many Humanitarian and Support Charities.  For comprehensive lists across many countries, you can visit [https://supportukrainenow.org](https://supportukrainenow.org/) and [https://helpukrainewin.org](https://helpukrainewin.org).

The [24.02 Fund](https://2402.org/) has been set up to help equip reporters and newsrooms in Ukraine with the necessary equipment, vehicles, and protective gear.

If you feel comfortable doing so you can donate directly to the Ukrainian Army from anywhere in the world via the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi) or [Monobank](https://uahelp.monobank.ua/).

Social Media
============

Be wary of sharing unverified content. The usual misinformation is flying around.  Look for multiple trusted sources sharing information before sharing it yourself.

Twitter
-------

Share your support for Ukraine for your network by writing a [tweet, or retweeting others](https://twitter.com/DivineOps/status/1498686097899102208).   Use the hashtag [#StandWithUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine?src=hashtag_click). [Provide Links to resources and Donations in a thread](https://twitter.com/DivineOps/status/1497941671945846784).

**Reach out to your local city and state leaders, reach out to your members of Congress, presidents, MPs, etc.**
