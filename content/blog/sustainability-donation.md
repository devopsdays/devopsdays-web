Starting 1 January 2025, a modest, localised event fee will be introduced. This
will be used solely to ensure a sustainable model to pay for the underlying
infrastructure that powers the DevOpsDays global community. Both the global
organisation and local events themselves will continue to be volunteer-run, and
none of these funds will be used to remunerate volunteers at any level.

You can read more about the program in the event organisers
guide: <https://devopsdays.org/organizing#sustainability-donation>

The guide update includes a number of FAQs, but if you have additional questions,
please get in touch via [info@devopsdays.org](mailto:info@devopsdays.org), 
or reach out on the organiser Slack.
