The obvious place to stay is the conference center itself. If you call the <a href="http://www.east-hotel.de/en/index.php?page=6&sub=0&subsub=0&subsubsub=0">East Hotel</a> conference center, they will probably say the hotel is fully booked. Luckily for you, <b>we have allocated a number of rooms especially for the conference</b>, but you need to specifically mention "devopsdays" conference name.

But Hamburg is a big place, and you can also go other places. Here are some hotels that are located near the conference center (indicated with the green house/flag).
This list has been made for your convenience and contains hotels ranging prices from 25 Euro till 140 Euro or even beyond. We haven't checked them personally but googlemaps was our friend in creating this list.
