**About Göteborg:**
Maybe you will have some time to spend outside the conference hotel, to be inspired have a look at this great video about <a href="http://vimeo.com/21430838">Göteborg</a>, don't worry you don't have to arrive like in the video, there are airports in Goteborg as well :)<br>

More info about <a href="http://www.goteborg.com/en/">the great city Göteborg</a>.<br>

**Hotels:**
The most convenient way to stay at the conference is to book a room at the Hotel itself. When you order, it is best you email to Ulrika.Nordstrom (at) elite.se and mention 'devopsdays' discount.
About 60 discounted rooms have been foreseen with a price of 1250 SEK/night (Incl Taxes), we had earlier information of a price of 1110 SEK/night but that was excl taxes, sorry for the confusion. As of 4th of September there actual are some better discounts that you can get if you book for two nights directly on the hotel site https://www.member.elite.se/eng/reservation

If you prefer to find another hotel then you have a choice of hotels <a href="http://book.goteborg.com/en/accommodation?filter=c%3D10517">here</a>

Both Gothenburg Landvetter Airport and Gothenburg City Airport is conveniently located close to the center.
