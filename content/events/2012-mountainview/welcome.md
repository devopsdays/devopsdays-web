<p>For the third year in a row, we are organizing a Devopsdays in MountainView.</p>

<p>It will take place on <b>Thursday 28 and Friday 29 of June</b></p>

<!--The event is **sold out**, but ... we have few alternatives for you:

- [Velocity 2012](http://velocityconf.com/) - the conference about Web Performance and Operations
- [WebPerfDays](http://webperfdays.org/) - the unconference that brings the webperformance community together
-->

<p>The event moved and will be located at the <a href="/events/2012-mountainview/location">Silicon Valley Cloud Center</a>.</p>

<p>The event is being live-streamed by BMC <a href="https://communities.bmc.com/communities/community/bsm_initiatives/devops">here</a></p>

<p>Expect the usual <a href="program">mixture of conference talks and openspaces</a></p>

<p>And ...  we are going to plan loads of extras to make this an awesome event!</p>
