The closest hotel is the <a href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/doubletree-suites-by-hilton-hotel-minneapolis-MSPLSDT/index.html">DoubleTree Suites</a>. Book at our discounted group rate ($149/night) no later than June 20th with code "DOM". Contact the organizers if we need to add rooms to the block; supplies are limited but can be increased upon request.
<p>
The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="http://www.metrotransit.org/airport.aspx">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. You can walk (under a mile), transfer to a free bus on the bus/bike/pedestrian Nicollet Mall in downtown, or take a short cab ride from the LRT. Uber is also available, as is car2go.

If you spend most of your time in places like Portland or Brooklyn, our metro will feel familiar, with its bike share stations, beautiful riverfront, and numerous craft brewery tap-rooms with food trucks in their parking lots. (Hey, a good excuse to stay Friday night!)
