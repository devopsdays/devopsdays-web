**Michael DeHaan: How You Will Create Tomorrow**

"DevOps" quickly became associated with a desire to improve operations culture but also a love for open source, and in open source automation tooling.  More recently, we have become much better at sharing not just code, but the ways we run infrastructure and companies. Spearheaded by social catalysts like DevOps days, meetup.com, GitHub, Speakerdeck, and YouTube, we're able to evolve and iterate faster by sharing across corporate boundaries. The IT field, once somewhat stagnant, is now evolving aggressively due to more rapid exchanges of ideas.<br><br>

 "Infrastructure as Code" means no longer just consuming vendor frameworks in source control, but blurring the line between "development" and operations - operations IS development now.  Rather than code an application that focuses on one machine, we code to drive the behavior of entire server fleets, and we can share that with folks in other companies.<br><br>

 With so many useful components, services, and libraries available, we're at a point where if anyone can decide to do something better than an existing technology, you can. Exciting aspects like higher level cloud services, continous deployment, immutable infrastructure, containers, microservices, distributed databases, logging analytics, machine learning, and more has only really come to fruition in the last handful of years -- and they open up tons of new capabilities. The future is perhaps even more exciting and unpredictable - and it will come from your keyboard.<br><br>

 **Michael DeHaan** created automation systems Cobbler and Ansible.  He lives in Morrisville, NC and does AWS and SRE things for Interactive Intelligence. Go Wolfpack!
