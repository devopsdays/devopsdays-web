The conference will take place Wednesday July 8 and Thursday July 9, 2015 at the <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/hilton-minneapolis-MSPMHHH/index.html">downtown Minneapolis Hilton</a>. We have a <a href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/DevOps">room rate of $169/night</a> for those who'd like to stay at the Hilton.
<p>

The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="http://www.metrotransit.org/airport.aspx">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. You can walk (under a mile), transfer to a free bus on the bus/bike/pedestrian Nicollet Mall in downtown, or take a short cab ride from the LRT. Uber & Lyft are also available, as is car2go.
<p>

If you spend most of your time in places like Portland or Brooklyn, our metro will feel familiar, with its bike share stations, beautiful riverfront, and numerous craft brewery tap-rooms with food trucks in their parking lots.
