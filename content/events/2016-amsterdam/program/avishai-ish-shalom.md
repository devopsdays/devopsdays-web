<p><strong>Title:</strong> The Mathematics of Reliability</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>We often hear talks of "scale" and "reliability", mostly based on personal experience and lessons learned. What can Mathematics tell us about reliability and scale? Can math help us make our systems and companies more reliable?
 It turns out that failure models, probability, statistics and other domains can help our analysis and provide insights.</p>

<p>This talk will present a simple failure models, explain the math behind common practices, introduce emergent system properties and showcase mathematical examples of why things behave differently at scale and how things that work well in small systems can be horrible at scale.</p>
