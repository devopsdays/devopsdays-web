<p><strong>Title:</strong> How the hell do I run my microservices in production, and will it scale?</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Let's assume you’ve already had every *Docker 101 tutorial* for breakfast. You’re now ready to take that brilliantly crafted application into production. But wait... first you need to test your container-based microservices architecture. What does the whole DevOps workflow look like? What about performance and security? And last but not least; how the hell do I run my microservices in production, and will it scale?</p>

<p>Let Daniël guide you through the wonderful world of container-based development and running microservice architectures at scale. By attending the talk*, you’ll gain insight into how to bootstrap and dive straight into learning what DevOps workflow should look like when using containers.</p>
