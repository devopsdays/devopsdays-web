<p><strong>Title:</strong> Continuous testing in the world of APIs</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>With testing late in the software development process, you risk discovering problems at a very late stage. You want to be able to test earlier so that: issues can be fixed earlier, submitted code is checked with every push/merge/build for example. We will tell you our story about what mistakes we made and how we learned to reach towards a continuous testing process.</P

<p>
 Some key mistakes and learnings we made are related to: <br />
 - Way of creating tests and test data <br />
 - Process of executing, maintaining tests and agreements surrounding it <br />
 - Applicability, evaluation of the tool stack we use(d) <br />
 </p>

 <p>We also learned continuously regarding our test implementation and acted upon these learnings. Therefore, we hope to share our story that others can relate/learn from the pain we suffered before we could enjoy our continuous testing process.</p>
