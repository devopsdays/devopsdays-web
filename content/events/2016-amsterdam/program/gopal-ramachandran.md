<p><strong>Title:</strong> Test driven Dockerized infrastructure</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Although Test driven development is a familiar thing, Test driven infrastructure is not so much. If you are moving to infrastructure-as-code, then it is important to implement the same Test-driven principle to infrastructure, for an automated IaaS delivery pipeline. In the world of containers, we have tools like serverspec and continerspec (which is based on cucumber) to ensure that the containers and images are configured as we want them to be. In this talk we look at how and what can be tested in this way, and the advantages and limitations of the testing methods. Test-driven infrastructure is not that difficult to implement after all.</p>
