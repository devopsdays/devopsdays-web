<p><strong>Title:</strong> Workshopping Bias: Designing Solutions to Improve Decision Making and Unleash Your Team's Potential</p>

<p>This workshop will provide an overview of how our brains process information and how those systems break down. We'll talk about a few specific types of unconscious bias and how they limit the potential of our teams and organizations. Then, participants will have a chance to test themselves and work together to identify subtle improvements to the way they evaluate candidates, direct reports, and their colleagues to interrupt biases where they appear.
