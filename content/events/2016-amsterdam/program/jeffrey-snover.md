Re-architecting Windows Server for DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Microsoft is taking the needs of DevOps seriously in Windows Server 2016. This release establishes the architectural foundation for a cloud paced world with a dramatic refactoring (Nano Server at @ 400MB), support for Desired State Configuration, ubiquitous testing with Pester, a new installer/package management system and a new security framework (Just in Time Admin and Just Enough Admin). Technical Fellow and Chief Architect for Windows Server, Jeffrey Snover, will describe these features and the motivation behind them.</p>
