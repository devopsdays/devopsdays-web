<p><strong>Title:</strong> Open Source Operations - punching up</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>As the complexity of software grows - machine learning, big data, container infrastructure - the burden is less on how to get the software, or install the software, but the knowledge it takes to run, maintain, and scale software.</p>

<p>Open Sourcing operations not only allows us to keep up, but punch up above our weight classes.</p>
