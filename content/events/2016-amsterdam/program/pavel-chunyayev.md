<p><strong>Title:</strong> The importance of ‘why’ for software operations.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>When working with multiple software development teams it is important to keep the teams motivated and aligned with each other while still allowing teams’ autonomy. Most architects and product managers try to focus on what needs to be done and how. However it’s more important to pay attention to why the change is needed or why the exact architecture is required. When teams know exactly why the change is needed they can find how to start and continue working without having to constantly align with architects and product management. ‘Why?’ is a hard question in software development. It’s even harder for software delivery. We know why should we automate our pipelines or why programmable infrastructure is better than snowflake server. But each one of use needs to be able to answer why we are doing this from the company mission or from the product ideas perspectives. Then we could link our daily work to something that has higher value.</p>
