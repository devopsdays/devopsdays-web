<p><strong>Title:</strong> Preparing for the Day After Tomorrow - Test-Driven Infrastructure</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>With infrastructure and application automation, we have gained the tools to change systems rapidly. However, with increased project size, complexity, and requirements, its is very challenging to meet the time and quality expectations. In order to build a high velocity organization, uncertainty and complexity need to be reduced to gain speed while working in a trusted environment. This talk will introduce a DevOps workflow that helps to establish trust in your software development and release process. Moreover, we will look into the management of divergent environments, from legacy systems to modern clouds by using InSpec and Test-Kitchen.</p>
