  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Taking Out the Garbage: Finding Memory Leaks in Node.js
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>To be Provided</p>

<p>
No one likes taking out the garbage. It’s gross. It’s smelly. It’s probably not even yours, but it must be done. Memory management in Node.js is no different. In this talk, seasoned DevOps advocate Will Button teaches you how to master garbage collection in Node.js. Memory management is often overlooked in Node.js applications. Common performance and scaling issues can be traced directly to memory leaks, resulting in a frustrating, poorly performing application. Failure to isolate and resolve these memory leaks means that you spend time, money and resources over-provisioning your environment. You will learn</p>

<p>
 • Enabling garbage collection statistics<br />
 • Recognizing the different types of garbage collection used by V8<br />
 • Understanding the metrics from the node.js garbage collector<br />
 • Identifying memory issues in your node.js applications (even before you look for them)<br />
 • Profiling your node.js server to understand your memory utilization<br />
 • Taking heapdump snapshots<br />
 • Structuring your code for better memory diagnosis<br />
 • Best practices for building scalable node.js applications<br />
 • Load testing Node.js applications<br />
</p>

<p>Developers, DevOps Engineers and Sysadmins of all levels will benefit from the practical, easy-to-use tips and tools presented. While no particular programming skill set or expertise is required, attendees should be familiar with Node.js. By the end of the talk, you will be able to perform memory profiling and diagnose memory leaks on Node.js applications using the free and open source tools demonstrated.
