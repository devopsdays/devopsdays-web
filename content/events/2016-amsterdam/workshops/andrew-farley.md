<p><strong>Title: Designing Scalable Services on Amazon’s Web Services</strong></p>

<p>Amazon offers a wide number of tools to architect scalable services in various ways.  This workshop will walk you through a handful of these approaches to both architect your own services, or modify existing softwares for scale.  By the end of this workshop, you will be familiar with the requirements for designing scalable services and various approaches to achieving this goal on AWS.  I’ll kick the workshop off with one main topic, and then based on interest and time we’ll cover the optional topics below.  The topics available include…</p>

<p>Main Topic
• Modifying an existing application for (auto)scale on AWS (Workshop with EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, AutoScaling, Deployment Strategies, Schema Change Strategies)</p>

<p>
Optional Topics (time permitting and interest-based)<br />
• Architecting Services without Servers (Workshop with AWS Lambda, NodeJS, Serverless, API Gateway, CloudFront)<br />
• Architecting Docker-based Microservices with Amazon’s Elastic Container Service (Workshop with ECS, RDS, Docker)<br />
• Explanation, demonstration and Q&A discussion of Continuous Delivery/Deployment Strategies and tools and their uses/usage pertaining to AWS<br />
• Scalable Services on AWS in a healthy DevOps culture (SNS, SQS, AWS Lambda, Slack)
</p>

<p>
