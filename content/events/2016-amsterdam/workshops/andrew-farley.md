  <p><strong>Title: Building Scalable Docker Services in Amazon’s Web Services with ECS</strong>
</p>

<p>

<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable container management service that makes it easy to run Docker-based services on Amazon. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure. This platform empowers companies to use Docker to reduce the differences between production and development environments. EC2 Container Service has a robust API that Amazon’s AWS services are known for to add further levels of automation.<p>

 <p>In this workshop (time permitting) we will…</p>

<p>
 • Show you the tools of the trade, and assist you to get your first Docker-based service launched on Amazon. <br />
 • Discuss and explain how their services that ECS relies on works, such as Autoscaling (AS), Autoscaling Groups (ASGs), Load Balancers (ELBs), and Security Groups. <br />
 • Discuss the necessary architecture of your application(s) to handle scale on ECS or AS <br />
 • Highlight differences you might have between development/staging/production-based ECS services. <br />
 • Explain integrations with other AWS-based services (such as RDS or ElastiCache) <br />
 • Answer any questions you might have about Amazon’s ECS or related services <br />
</p>

 <p>To participate in this workshop and to maximize what you can get out of this workshop, you will need to bring a functional unix-based computer with…</p>

<p>
 • A functional Amazon AWS Account (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com">https://aws.amazon.com</a>) <br />
 • Amazon’s CLI toolkit installed (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">https://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a>) <br />
 • Amazon’s CLI toolkit configured on your machine (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html</a>) <br />
 • Docker installed and functional on your machine <br />
 • Mac - <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/</a><br />
 • Ubuntu - <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/</a><br />
 • CentOS - <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/</a><br />
 • Test to ensure docker is working by running a hello world application <br />
