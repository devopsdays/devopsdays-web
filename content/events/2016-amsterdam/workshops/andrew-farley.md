  <p><strong>Title: Building Scalable Docker Services in Amazon’s Web Services with ECS</strong>
</p>

<p>Amazon offers a wide number of tools to architect scalable services in various ways.  This workshop will walk you through a handful of these approaches to both architect your own services, or modify existing softwares for scale.  By the end of this workshop, you will be familiar with the requirements for designing scalable services and various approaches to achieving this goal on AWS.  We’ll do a workshop on as many of the topics below based on that topic’s popularity and the time available; at the start of the workshop we’ll take a vote and go from there.  The topics available include…</p>

<p>
• Modifying an existing application for (auto)scale on AWS (Workshop with EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, AutoScaling, Deployment Strategies, Schema Change Strategies)<br />
• Architecting Services without Servers (Workshop with AWS Lambda, NodeJS, Serverless, API Gateway, CloudFront)<br />
• Building apps on a Platform as a Service (Workshop with Elastic Beanstalk, PHP, ElastiCache)<br />
• Architecting Docker-based Microservices with Amazon’s Elastic Container Service (Workshop with ECS, RDS, Docker)<br />
• Explanation, demonstration and Q&A discussion of Continuous Delivery/Deployment Strategies and tools and their uses/usage pertaining to AWS<br />
• Scalable Services on AWS in a healthy DevOps culture (SNS, SQS, AWS Lambda, Slack)<br />
</p>

<p>
To participate in this workshop and to maximize what you can get out of this workshop, you will need…<br />
• A functional unix-based or unix-friendly computer / VM <br />
• A functional Amazon AWS Account (https://aws.amazon.com) <br />
• Amazon’s CLI toolkit installed (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) <br />
• Amazon’s CLI toolkit configured on your machine (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html) <br />
• Docker installed and functional on your machine (if participating/interested in ECS) <br />
    • Test to ensure docker is working by running a hello world application <br />
    • https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockerizing/“ <br />
• NodeJS v4.x Installed (For Lambda, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk) <br />
• A general understanding of AWS concepts and technologies and/or interest to learn<br />
• A general understanding of some of the various technologies and concepts above and/or interest to learn<br />
• A little experience with scripting/programming will also help speed your education of this workshop but is not necessary<br />
• I welcome beginners, but I may only be able to spend so much time at this level of assistance.  Find or contact me afterwards if you want to ask me questions I could not answer during the workshop.</p>

<p>
In this workshop I will provide…<br />
• Slides at the start of the chat<br />
• Demo/Sample API endpoints to be used by some of the workshop<br />
• Various sample codebases and/or tools in various git repositories to be used in the workshop<br />
• A friendly helpful guide to explore various tools and technologies with you<br />
