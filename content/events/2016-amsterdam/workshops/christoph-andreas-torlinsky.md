  <p><strong>Title: A Place for SDN in DevOps</strong>

</p>

<p>
This workshop will demonstrate how Software Defined Networking has found it's place in 2016 - we believe there is now a credible use case for this technology to make Networking less of a "Black Hole" or Work-in-Progess blocker for DevOps teams to unite and deliver faster together. There will be a short demo on how this achieved programmatically.
