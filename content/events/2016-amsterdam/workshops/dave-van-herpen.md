<p><strong>Title: Creating high-performance teams with DevOps behavior</strong></p>

<p>
High-performance teams are NOT the teams with the newest tools or the coolest pipelines. High-performance teams are teams showing ""the right behavior"" every single day.
</p>

<p>
But what is this "right behavior" in the DevOps context? And how can you help your team mates in achieving this?
</p>

<p>
 And how do you effectively change (read: positively manipulate) the behavior of all the stakeholders in your domain, like your fellow team members, your customers, your manager, or that awful guy from compliancy & risk?
</p>

<p>
 This highly interactive workshop will give you real practical instruments, tips & tricks (all based on scientific & practical evidence and experience) how to help truly create a high-performance environment in your organization.
