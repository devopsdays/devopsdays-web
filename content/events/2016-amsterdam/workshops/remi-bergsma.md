  <p><strong>Title: Build your own Cloud in record time with Cosmic</strong></p>

<p>

<p>In this workshop you will learn how to build your own Cloud and play with it!</p>

<p>Cosmic Cloud is an IaaS platform geared towards Mission Critical workloads. We made it so easy that anyone can set it up and use it. Cosmic was forked off of on Apache CloudStack. The main reason was that we wanted to move much faster. In 2016 so far we did about 50 releases and deployed those to production. Our record is 5 times a day.</p>

<p>We'll walk trough building your Cloud, but also on how to use it. What management tool to use. How to automate deployments with tools like CloudMonkey and Terraform. How to test changes and make sure nothing breaks.</p>

<p>By the end of the workshop you are able to set it up yourself, you understand the concepts and have played with Cosmic quite a bit. And of course, you have asked any question you had :-)</p>

<p><strong>Please bring your laptop! See ya there!</strong></p>
