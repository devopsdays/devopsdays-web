<p><strong>Title: Out with the old, in with the new – Modernizing Application Deployment with Habitat</strong></p>

<p>
I created DAFNE Online, a website for people with Type 1 Diabetes back in 2008. I’d heard about this awesome new web application framework called Ruby on Rails so decided to learn that and implement the site using it, mainly because I like learning new stuff. Back then I was purely on the Dev side of DevOps and wasn’t too bothered about how the application was going to run in production, so with the aid of Google search and a few pieces of string I cobbled together a solution to get the app up and running on the web. Fast forward to 2016 and it was still running on the same basic stack – which was very outdated and required a manual effort to fix with every deployment.
</p>

<p>
Enter a new way of deployment offered by Chef called <a href="https://www.habitat.sh">Habitat</a>, which allowed me to keep the environment up to date and automatically deploy the application without any fix or manual effort needed. In this workshop I'll give you a hands on snapshot of the journey from the old to the new, and show how this technology can configure and deploy Rails applications with ease.
