<p><strong>Title: Implementing a CI and CD Pipeline with GitHub</strong></p>

<p>
GitHub makes it easy to collaborate on code, but its true power comes when it is used as the centrepiece of a modern deployment pipeline.
</p>

<p>
This workshop will start with an overview of Git and GitHub, then deep dive into the concepts behind Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), two cornerstones of good software development. After that, we'll cover how to start incorporating these practices into your workflow, by using GitHub to integrate with best-of-breed 3rd party tools.
</p>

<p>
This workshop is designed for those with intermediate Git and GitHub knowledge, but limited hands-on experience implementing CI/CD practices.
</p>
