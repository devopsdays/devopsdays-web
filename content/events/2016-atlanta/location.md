## Airport

There is a taxi stand outside of the baggage claim at the airport. Most taxi companies have a flat, standard rate from the airport to Midtown of $32. You may pay a little less or a little more, but please be aware about the taxi that you choose: ensure that it’s a legitimate taxi company and agree upon how the price will be determined (flat rate or meter) before putting your luggage inside. If you need help, do not hesitate to ask an airport employee; we’re known to be polite here in Georgia! Unfortunately, [ride-share companies like Uber](http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/24/business/taxi-and-uber-fight-curb-atlanta-airport) are not allows to pick-up customers at the airport.

## Public Transportation

[MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/) serves the Historic Academy of Medicine. Follow the signs from baggage claim at the airport to get to the MARTA station. From Hartsfield International Airport take MARTA to the Midtown Station. The Historic Academy of Medicine is less than a quarter-mile walk from the MARTA station, or ride the [Georgia Tech Trolly](http://pts.gatech.edu/Documents/trolley%20rambler%2014%2015%20map.pdf).

## Lodging

The [Renaissance Atlanta Midtown Hotel](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/atlbd-renaissance-atlanta-midtown-hotel/) is conveniently located across from the Historic Academy of Medicine. We have not reserved any special rates with the hotel.
