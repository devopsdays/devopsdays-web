  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Come to Germany, Pepe!
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p> 
Presented as a message to a former colleague still in a more traditional IT Ops role who would like to “devops” but is not sure how, this hopefully entertaining talk covers the cultural and technological journey from being in an old-school Systems Department at a telecoms company to the world of “Devops” filled with buzzwords, 100x more recruiter emails, and co-workers born when I was in high school. From the perspective of an engineer just turned 40, topics will cover life in German startups, what Devops means and how I’ve seen it implemented, what tools and skills you would need to make the switch, and why you would want to.
