  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Boost your Graphs
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Graphs. All operators and most of the developers use them to
identify problems and forecast trends. There are so many solutions out
there to collect and visualize data. Currently one of the most famous is
Grafana. Used with multiple backends, it is capable to correlate data
from very different sources. 
<br>
In my ignite talk I will show how one can
see dynamic thresholds in a graph, while deployments, puppet runs or SSH
logins are displayed in the same graph. This can be achived by combining
multiple tools: Icinga2, Graphite, Elastic Stack and Grafana. I will
show an example on how a single graph can tell a whole story. Beginning
from a user doing a deployment, a server starting to fail, up to another
user logging in and fixing the issue.
