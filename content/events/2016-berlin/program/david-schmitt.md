  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Diversity vs. Cultural Fit
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Cultural Fit and Diversity are two over-used concepts that betray themselves by their apparent opposition: Hiring for cultural fit reduces diversity, and vice versa. First I will point out some of the things that went wrong in this area over the last years: e.g. the rise and fall of Political Correctness, or statistic-based diversity initiatives. Finally I ask you to stop slacking off and do the right things:

* Instead of fitting people in, hire for cultural fitness! You need folks that can listen, understand, and act, not people that blend in.

* Instead of paying lipservice to (at best) partial solutions, actively make folks of all backgrounds feel welcome in your team, company, or community.

If we don't make the world a better place, who else would do it for us?
