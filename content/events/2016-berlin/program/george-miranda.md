  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Dissecting the Role-Cookbook Pattern
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Have you heard about Roles in Chef Server? Have you heard that “best practice” says not to use them because they’re not versionable? Have you been warned not to store attributes in Roles? Well what if we could have it all? What if we could use Roles that were versionable and were safe to store attributes in? Well you’re in luck — we can! Join me as we dive into the Role-Cookbook Pattern and learn that we can, indeed, have our cake and eat it too!
