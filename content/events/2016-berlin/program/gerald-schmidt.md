  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Turtles all the way down: native containers, native code
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
We need to talk about our reliance on virtualization.
<br>
 Most of us seem to be running Java virtual machines on top of virtual machines, so I’d like to look at both VMs and the JVM. At a time when performance is at a high premium in terms of power consumption and cost of compute cycles, are the trade-offs still worth it?
<br>
Now is a good time to take stock of how far container and technology and tooling have caught up with full virtualization, and to gauge the promise of a new family of languages that compile to native code. It’s hardly a coincidence that one of them, Go, dominates Linux container management and orchestration.
<br>
Nevertheless, the last time this question came up, the decision taken was to place all containers on a VM layer; the JVM was never in doubt. Is it too early to dream of native code running in native containers on physical hardware?
