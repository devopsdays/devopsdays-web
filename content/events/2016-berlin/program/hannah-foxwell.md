  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Information Overload and the Real Costs of Interruptions
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p> Lift your head from the screen for a second. Reflect for a moment on where your attention is. Is it where it’s supposed to be? Where you want it to be? Probably not. Where is it instead? 
<br>  
Ask yourself why. Why did I start checking twitter, facebook, slack, hipchat anyway? Why did I just pick up my phone? I’m sure I felt a vibration...hmmm maybe not. 
<br>
If we begin with the assumption that our time is our most precious asset then we have a problem. Our attention and our time are being fought over all day every day, and no one is immune to this type of “digital disruption”.  Productivity is plummeting, anxiety and stress are prevalent. Email Apnea is a thing. 
<br>
In this talk we’ll look at our relationship to technology in the workplace and what this impact has on culture, job satisfaction, productivity and mental health. 
<br>
We’ll also discuss what we can do as individuals and teams to get better and to help each other.  </p> <p>
