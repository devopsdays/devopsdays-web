  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Next Generation Config Mgmt
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
A presentation about a next gen config management tool, and the
specific problems this project solves.
<br>
Three of the main design features of the tool include:
<ul>
<li>Parallel execution</li>
<li>Event driven mechanism</li>
<li>Distributed architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>
This talk will demo a prototype I've built that implements these ideas
and which is written in golang. I will also show the automatic edge,
automatic grouping and automatic elastic etcd clustering management
features.
<p>
An introductory blog post on the subject is available. https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/ Attendees are encouraged to read it before the talk if they are interested!
