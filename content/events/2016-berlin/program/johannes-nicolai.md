How GitHub uses GitHub to develop and deploy GitHub
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

Learn how GitHub's globally distributed teams use GitHub tooling to develop GitHub, collaborate with 
engineering, sales, marketing, services and legal and deploy more than 500 times a week. Experience 
ChatOps, a great way to reduce friction between development and operations and super efficient 
way to bring new engineers up to speed.
See life examples on how to use Hubot to retrieve log files, graph various metrics and deploy pull 
requests directly from Slack to Heroku. Get some ideas how to build such a ChatOps environment 
yourself.
