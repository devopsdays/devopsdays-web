  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Infrastructure as a Microservice
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
The micro service paradigm goes well with the notion of agile, autonomous full stack development teams. But what about the underlying infrastructure like CI/CD systems, monitoring, log analytics, message busses and so on? These are often build as monolithic services maintained by centralised teams. All the scalability woes and maintenance issues that we would liked to have left behind great again.<br> 
Instead these services can be built as appliances that are used in self-service by the product development teams. At ImmobilienScout teams get dedicated accounts in the cloud that they fully own and that come with all the supporting services.<br>
It adds some challenges to the game: How to package, distribute and update this distributed infrastructure? Whoâ€™s monitoring and taking responsibility when one these components breaks? High reliability and proper documentation are needed.<br>
In the end providing all the teams with self service infrastructure enables a truly distributed service landscape that scales up and down along the needs of the business.
