  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Looking back at 7 years of DevOpsDays
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
7 years ago we had the idea to organise a conference in Gent to bridge the gap between developers and the people runing their code.  It was the start of a new global movement.  This talk will guide you trough that journey and discuss some of the things we learned along the way.
