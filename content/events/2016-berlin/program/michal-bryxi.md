Git and Github Tricks
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
I like git. And I love GitHub. As a developer and tech-savvy person I spend quite a lot of my time working with version control & ticketing systems. And as a human, I’m lazy. So I’m always looking for ways to make my everyday routine easier with the use of technology. 
<br>
Luckily the folks from GitHub are the same and are trying hard to make our everyday life easier too.
This talk will bring you some tips & tricks for everyday git(hub) usage including these how-to’s:
<ul>
<li>Separate your private & work github life</li>
<li>Create only clean PRs</li>
<li>Encourage people to create helpful PR messages</li>
<li>Diffing is hard</li>
<li>Easier issue lifecycle</li>
<li>Make sure that all links are equal</li>
</ul>
