  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
DevOps? That's not my job!
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Hey, I’m an application developer and I’m done managing my server infrastructure. Stop slowing me down.
<br>
Application developers are sick and tired of being slowed down by having to learn new tasks and care about mundane details. I don’t care about server infrastructure. In fact, I hate DevOps! I don’t need to worry about the differences between cloud and a data center; the applications I create are brilliant, running them is not my job. Let’s talk about walls and boundaries. You do your job, I’ll do mine, and we can both get back to moving fast.
<br>
This talk is inspired, in part, by http://thenewstack.io/serverless-computing-growing-quickly/ As someone practicing DevOps for a number of years it’s really easy to let quotes like this make you cry: “DevOps significantly adds to the development time as application builders are weighed down by the need to manage their server infrastructure at the same time.”
