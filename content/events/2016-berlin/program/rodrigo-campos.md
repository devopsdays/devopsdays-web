  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Building a Culture of Builders - The adventures of building an engineering team at Facebook London
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p> 
Production Engineering (PE) is the team that greases the gears of hundreds of systems at Facebook. We use different engagement models to work with several teams and make sure that all the pieces stay together, as well as put together the pieces that eventually fall apart. This talk will cover the process of stablishing the PE presence in a thriving and quickly growing engineering office in London, detail the different engagement models that we use and the bumps and bruises we got along the
way.
<br> 
 Topics that will be covered include:<br>
 <ul>
 <li>Working on different time zones</li>
 <li>Hiring and ramping up new engineers</li>
 <li>Building up local expertise</li>
 <li>How to identify and fit people in the right role</li>
 </ul>
