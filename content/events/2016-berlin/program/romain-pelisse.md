  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Chef vs. Ansible
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
My friend François Le Droff and I would like to submit a proposal for the upcoming Berlin Devops Days named (for now) "Chef vs Ansible". This would be a hands on lab, where we would walkthrough the attendees into setting up a server (including some services and a webapp) using either Chef and Ansible.
<br>
During the hands on, we will cover the main features of each technologies, and point out both their common grounds, limitations and qualities. The aims is also to help "troubleshoot" their issue on the selected technologies, and therefore getting out of the session an interactive tutorial.
