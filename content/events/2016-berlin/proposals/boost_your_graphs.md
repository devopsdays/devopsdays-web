### Boost your Graphs

**Abstract:**

Graphs. All operators and most of the developers use them to identify problems and forecast trends. There are so many solutions out there to collect and visualize data. Currently one of the most famous is Grafana. Used with multiple backends, it is capable to correlate data from very different sources. 

In my ignite talk I will show how one can see dynamic thresholds in a graph, while deployments, puppet runs or SSH logins are displayed in the same graph. This can be achived by combining multiple tools: Icinga2, Graphite, Elastic Stack and Grafana. I will show an example on how a single graph can tell a whole story. Beginning from a user doing a deployment, a server starting to fail, up to another user logging in and fixing the issue.
