### Fight your traditional monitoring - A story on how to break bad habits and replace them with good ones

**Abstract:**

In the wold of DevOps, sometimes it feels like time is flying.  Almost every day we get new tools and techniques that will solve our problems once and for all. But one thing still remains the same: Monitoring. Event though we have conferences like Monitorama, where #monitoringlove is propagated, it still feels like everyone is keeping their same old habits when it comes to monitoring. 

In my talk I want to present different techniques that can be used with Icinga2 to replace those habits with good ones. The talk will include rule based configuration, introduce variants of automation and finally lead to a solution that imports information from different sources like a custom CMDB, Puppet or Active Directory. The goal is to combine these informations into one monitoring configuration. Fully automated, and versioned. In my talk I want to call attention, that the wold of monitoring has changed and we don't need to do anything manually anymore, as long as we have stored these informations somewhere in our systems.
