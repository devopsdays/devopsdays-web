### KPI and Metric Management for DevOps

**Abstract:**

Performance issues with webapplictaions usually have the same source: Slow databases, inefficient codes and too many db requests. Therefore, to analyze the performance of your software you should focus on the full stack between your back-end to your front-end. In particular, changes within the code can not only cause functional errors, but also result in overall slower performance. 

On the other hand, in a dynamic environment the datacenter becomes an integral part of your application, hence there is an increasing need to monitor the resource usage within the datacenter and what effect it might have on the application. Right now, over 70% of developers spend their time on fixing bugs instead of rather focussing  on innovation and continues delivery. This presentation will examine a practical approach to proactively solve performance issues and how to bring developers and the operation team together.
