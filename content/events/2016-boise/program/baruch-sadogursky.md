## Patterns and Antipatterns in Docker Image Lifecycle
While Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it is all too easy to spin out of control. 
A promotion-based model is required to control and track the flow of Docker images as much as it is required for a traditional software development lifecycle.
New tools often introduce new paradigms. We will examine the patterns and the antipatterns for Docker image management, and what impact the new tools have on the battle-proven paradigms of the software development lifecycle.

## DevOps @Scale
Co-Presented with [Leonid Igolnik](/events/2016-boise/program/leonid-igolnik/)

Remember the times when one server was enough? And a guy named “sysadmin” was babysitting it along with his other duties of installing MS Office for everybody? For better or for worse, those times are long gone. Today, companies manage tens of thousands of servers and perform thousands of production changes per day. In this talk we will look at the resources, techniques and tools needed for managing DevOps at Scale and we will discuss the challenges that companies encounter when they hit it.
