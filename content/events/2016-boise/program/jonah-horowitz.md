## Configuration Management is an Anti-Pattern
Configuration Management tools were a revolution when they first appeared. Gone were the days of every Sys Admin carrying around their own collection of Bash scripts to get things done. It's no surprise that they became so popular so quickly. That said, the age of Configuration Management is quickly coming to an end. Serverless and immutable infrastructure are the future.
In this talk you'll hear from one of Netflix's CORE SREs about how we run on a mostly immutable infrastructure, all the ways that Configuration Management has failed over the years and why you should stop using it.
