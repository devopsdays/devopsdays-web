  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Going "serverless" with Lambdas
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  "Serverless" apps are built not as contained services but rather as lean handlers that respond to events. Not just the server but the entire application platform is offloaded to "the cloud", meaning a more manageable application architecture that can scale dynamically as your application grows.
