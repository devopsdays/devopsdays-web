    <p><strong>Title:</strong>
    Ansible: Your First Two Hours
    </p>

    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

    <p>
    Learning any new tool can be intimidating, particularly if your company
    doesn’t encourage experimentation. This tutorial is designed to get you
    comfortable writing Ansible playbooks for routine operations tasks in just
    two hours, even if you’ve never heard of it before.<br>
    <br>
    The first 30 minutes of the workshop will position you to evaluate Ansible by
    relating it to the broader ecosystem of devops tools. You’ll learn the key
    concepts that define Ansible workflows (inventories, playbooks, roles, and
        variables) and how they compare to concepts from other systems. By the
    break, you’ll understand Ansible’s strengths and weaknesses relative to other
    options, giving you the information you need to decide whether it’s right for
    your team, or to sell it effectively to your manager.<br>
    <br>
    The second portion of the workshop will consist of live Ansible exercises.
    You’ll work your way up from a “Hello, World” playbook on localhost to
    deploying and managing a multi-server microservice application (via Vagrant).
    Along the way, you’ll learn about the most important Ansible modules, the fine
    points of Ansible repository structure, and the wider world of Ansible Galaxy.
    And since Ansible’s greatest weakness is its flexibility, we’ll also show you
    what not to do in order to avoid costly refactoring in the future! By the close
    of the workshop, you will be comfortable using Ansible to automate routine
    operations tasks, and you’ll know where to start with Ansible for
    infrastructure-as-code.<br>

    <b>NOTE: A laptop with internet access, git, VirtualBox, and Vagrant are
    required for the second portion of the tutorial. Please install these tools in
    advance. Additionally, it’s recommended to come to this tutorial familiar with
    at least two of git, ssh, and Vagrant. On the other hand, you don’t have to
    have used configuration management previously to benefit from this
    workshop.</b>
