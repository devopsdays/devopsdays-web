  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  If You Build it, They Will Come: But Will They Stay?
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  How do you create the best devop you can be? When building a devop, we usually
  think about our technical skills but often forget aspects of our personal brand
  including relationship building, reputation, communication... all on top of the
  awesomeness you already can do. Let's talk about building the 'well rounded
  devop'. After we've built the devop of our dreams, how do you keep such awesome
  devops working in your company? Based on Jill's experience working with many
  engineers as well as perspectives from small (DigitalOcean), medium
  (Rackspace), and large (IBM) companies we'll discuss what it takes to become a
  sparkly devop unicorn.
