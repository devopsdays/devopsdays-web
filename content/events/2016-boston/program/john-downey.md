  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Debugging TLS/SSL
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  I've found when working with many developers and operations folks that there is a real lack of understanding with regards to how TLS/SSL works. This talk was originally given internally at Braintree to help folks understand this important part of the stack.
