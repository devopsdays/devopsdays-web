  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  DevOps in the Intelligence Community
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  We all know and love DevOps. But how do we bring DevOps to the ultimate waterfall enterprise (the US Government)? It's not easy and we're not out of the woods yet. I'd like to share with you the story of my journey and where we are heading so that others may follow in our footsteps.
