  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Fullstack Serverless at Scale
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  "Serverless". It is already being called the buzzword of 2016. Steve is going to bring "serverless" back to reality by showing how Bustle has built a fully serverless application platform. Real production examples handling millions of API calls a day. You will leave knowing if the hype is justified.
