<p>
DevOpsDays Boston is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that
depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths or sell product
presentations. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches
during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media
before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent
themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an
open space session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy
marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression
on the attendees.

<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at
DevOpsDays on their own terms.  </p>
