<p><strong>Title:</strong> DevOps vs Hardware: Round 2</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>In July 2015, Nomanini got an order to produce thousands of a hardware point of sale terminal that only existed in a sales pitch. Some might have called it vaporware - we called it a challenge.

Using practices honed during our first four years of building and deploying hardware, firmware and software we were able to launch our second product, from nothing, in less than six months.

This talk will cover our small teams' big lessons learned while designing hardware and manufacturing at scale, and running a highly available transaction backend.</p>
