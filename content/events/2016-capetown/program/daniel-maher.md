<p><strong>Title:</strong> Where are we going and how did we get here?</p>

<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The term Devops was coined in 2008 as a
tongue-in-cheek moniker for the process of getting developers and operations
people to speak to each other. From those humble origins, it has today
blossomed into a worldwide phenomenon, encompassing everything from software
development methodologies, enterprise software packages, training,
certifications, and more. It seems like everywhere you look, Devops is there -
but what is it, and what does it mean?
</p>
<p>
In this talk we'll get back to basics and examine the living history of Devops,
including the context from which the movement came to exist, how it has evolved
until today, and where we're potentially headed in the next few years. Along
the way we'll meet some colourful characters, cut through the marketing jargon,
and get to the essence of Devops itself.
