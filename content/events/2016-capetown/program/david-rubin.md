<p><strong>Title:</strong> Migrating at Scale</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Change is hard! Everyone always talks about new shiny tools and “Devops” but what happens when you have a product that does billions of pageviews with teams that span multiple continents and timezones with more than a few hundred engineers (2000+ total employees).

In this talk David will highlight some of the challenges OLX experienced with a recent move from high spec physical servers to running container based orchestration on AWS using versioned infrastructure. He also touches on how we dealt with keeping our teamwork great as well as the platform architecture.
