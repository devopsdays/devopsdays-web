  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Fear and (Self) Loathing in IT – A Healthy Discussion on Imposter Syndrome
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Many of us feel nervous or fearful about fully engaging with our teams, lest we be "found out" as an imposter who doesn't belong there. Imposter Syndrome is not silly, trivial, or something you’ll “just grow out of”. Many people have been experiencing Imposter Syndrome since childhood. But when does this anxiety become unhealthy? Is Imposter syndrome something we really even NEED to cure? As a fellow imposter, I’d like to share some of my own adventures in embracing my fears, learning to trust myself, and getting comfortable with asking for help.
