  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
The answer to the “where do we start” question
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Where do we start? This is by far the question I’m asked the most when talking to people about implementing continuous delivery. Unlike other types of long journeys, the answer is rarely “at the beginning”.
</p>
<p>
One of the best ways to determine the best place to start is to figure out where you’re wasting the most resources, and one of the best ways to do that is to create a value stream map.
</p>
<p>
We’ll go over what a value stream map is, how you can create one, and how it can help you answer some important questions about your business. Questions like “where do we start?”.
