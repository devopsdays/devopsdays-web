  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
What I’ve learned interviewing more than 150 people face to face
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
’ve been part of growing Puppet from 35 to 450+ people over the last five years. I’ve spent many hundreds of hours on the hiring process - but really want to dig into the interview. I’ll highlight the 10,000 hour rule from Anders Ericsson (made famous by M Gladwell) on experience and measurement of success by tying that in with deliberate practice/continuous improvement when it comes to interviewing. I’ll share some science, some practices (such as my 6 question interview) and some humor to hopefully shift your thoughts interviewing and hiring - all in 5 minutes.
