  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Building resilience in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
We talk about redundancy and security when it comes to our infrastructure and applications, but we rarely think about creating those same things in our teams and ourselves.
</p>
<p>
From the start-up financial roller coaster to a teammate's marriage (or divorce) to our own personal issues, success, scaling, and our future depend on complex and often chaotic factors.
</p>
<p>
In order to succeed, we need to create resilience, not just in our technology, but also in our organizations, our teams, and ourselves.
