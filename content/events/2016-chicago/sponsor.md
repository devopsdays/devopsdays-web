<hr>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that
depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths or sell product
presentations. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator
pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website
and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are
encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and
engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the
opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space
session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy
marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good
impression on the attendees.
<br>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
