  <p><strong>Title: Banking on DevOps</strong>

</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>It can be discouraging to implement technology in large enterprises. In financial services it's only compounded with legacy regulations and compliance. Add to that the risk, audit and internal security groups that want to be extremely proactive with process to ensure the company's safety. With all of that protection, much gets lost in translation when executing. Buildup of manual workflow, fear of change to processes that are proven to work, and the confusion with the number of communication points create a lengthy error-prone delivery process. Enterprises can be risk adverse adopting new things; this impacts the culture of engineering required to deliver reliable software quickly. At KeyBank, we have over-time created these issues with the standard support of legacy software, acquired complexity, and a continued focus on cost optimization. Luckily Key has great leaders that understand software delivery is a critical strength required to excel and technology is an important focus area</p>
