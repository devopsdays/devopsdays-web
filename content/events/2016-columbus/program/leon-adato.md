  <p><strong>Title: Getting Away from it All - Living an Unplugged Life as an IT</strong>

</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Most IT professionals spend some of their weekend on work stuff. Check email, work on a design, do some research, or on a "fun" project.</p>

<p>After 25 yrs in IT I finally realized that rarely does this help me get ahead. Mostly it makes me feel crushed, rushed, and stretched to the limit.</p>

<p>Not too long ago I started disconnecting for one day every week - totally unplugging. Not just me, but my whole family. Unsurprisingly, doing this did not drive us to the brink of madness.</p>

<p>This is my story, and the lessons I've learned.</p>
