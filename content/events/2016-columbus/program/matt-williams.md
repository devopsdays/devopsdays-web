<p><strong>Description: ITIL in an Agile World</strong></p>

<p>Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
   Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat;</p>

<p>But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,</p>

<p>When two strong men stand face to face, tho’ they come from the ends
   of the earth! -- Kipling</p>

<p>ITIL has a bad name among Agile and DevOps practitioners.
   But once you strip away the ceremony and the high priced consultants,
   ITIL outlines a series of best practices for IT Service Management
   (ITSM), such as change management, configuration management, problem
   management, and process improvement. While these
   are good ideas, conflict arises in the implementation and the
   terminology used -- consultants charge by the syllable. Maybe it's all
   the "managers", each with their own silo and layers of complexity.</p>

<p>Despite FUD and mis-communication, the two camps do not have to be enemies.</p>

<p>There is a common ground where Agile and ITIL can meet and work together as brothers in arms.</p>
