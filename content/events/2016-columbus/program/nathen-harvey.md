</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Successful DevOps requires collaboration. Collaboration improves when you grow from colleagues to a community.</p>

<p>This is an exploration of the community-side of DevOps. How do you participate in the larger DevOps community? How do you build an “internal” community around DevOps practices? Open source?! how do I even start with contributing to the community?</p>

<p>Hear about some successful teams are incorporating lessons learned from open source, DevOps, and other communities. Leave with some ideas of things to try in your own environment.</p>
