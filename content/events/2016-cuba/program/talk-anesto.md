Weâ€™ll share experiences during the implementation of our current software delivery system.
Our initial goal was to achieve faster development and deployment cycles of quality products,
in a reliable and sustainable way. The main challenges we faced and our achievements in terms of
product planning, feature development, continuous integration, change and configuration management
and continuous delivery will be exposed during the presentation.
