A good dose of Linux, common sense and Ruby help Bernard through the day. His days are mainly taken up with troubleshooting, debugging and optimising existing setups.

Furthermore, he spends a substantial amount of his time keeping track of the current state of technology and testing and evaluating promising projects and tools. Sometimes, albeit mostly against his will, he is involved in the pre-sales thinking process.

Outside office hours he does more of the same. He only makes an exception for his wife and son, his five year plan to renovate his home and having the occasional drink with friends and family.
