In order to understand current IT organizations, Patrick Debois has made a habit of changing both his consultancy role and the domain that he works in: sometimes as a developer, manager, sysadmin, or tester, and even as the customer. If there is one thing that annoys him, it is the great divide between all these groups. Patrick first presented concepts on Agile infrastructure at Agile 2008 in Toronto, and in 2009 he organized the first devopsdays. Since then he has been promoting the notion of DevOps to exchange ideas between these groups, and show how they can help each other to achieve better results in business.
