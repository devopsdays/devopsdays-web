**Title:**  DevOps for Normals - what’s happening as donkeys adopt DevOps 

**Description:**

In a post-unicorn era of DevOps, as “donkeys” start to adopt and use DevOps, what’s working and not working? This talk with present my current observations and advice on the topic, as well as a quick assessment of “the state of DevOps.”

In the past two years, DevOps has clearly gone mainstream which is creating all sorts of interesting experiments to observe as “normal” companies, outside of technology, adopt DevOps practices. These companies are often beguiled by the core berries to DevOps adoption - a corporate culture and processes that are built around slow, project-mindset driven application delivery - but are also encountering problems unique to “normals” like dealing with legacy code, audit and compliance, and managers who don’t quite seem to get how computers work.

I’ve been studying these stories over recent years and will present what I’ve observed organized into best and worst practices. My goal is always to give helpful advice that can actually be put into practice once the audience goes back to work.
