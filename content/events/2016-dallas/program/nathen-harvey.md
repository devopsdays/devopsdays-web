Let's look back on the history of DevOps through the eyes of someone who's been a community participant from the early days of the movement.  As we do so, we'll look at some tips you can takeaway to help make sure your DevOps Days DFW experience is delightful.  Be prepared to learn, be prepared to make new friends, and, most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
