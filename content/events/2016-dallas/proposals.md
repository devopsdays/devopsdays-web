<h2>Conference Talks</h2>

We know many of you are anxious to submit your CFP. We're almost ready and will be opening it up on May 9th.
<br><br>
But here's a PREVIEW so that you can get a head start preparing... 
<br><br>
For DevOpsDays Dallas 2016, we are actively soliciting programming that addresses these topics:
<br><br>
* Software development practices for the DevOps world<br>
* Velocity, sustainability, and technical debt<br>
* Quantifying productivity, failure, and risk metrics<br>
* Professional development, teaching, training, and mentorships<br>
* Emotional labor and empathy<br>
* Teaching junior engineers how to be senior engineers<br>
* Mental health, stress, and burnout<br>
* Learning lessons from other fields (manufacturing, military, etc.)<br>
<br>
We will also accept submissions on perennially popular topics as discussed at other DevOpsDays:<br>
* Continuous Deployment<br>
* Automation<br>
* Containerization<br>
* Performance Monitoring<br>
* Configuration Management<br>
* DevOps in the Enterprise<br>
* Microservices<br>
* Managed Services<br>
* Development methodology<br>
* Scaling out DevOps<br>
* Hiring for DevOps<br>

However, please consider that novelty is heavily encouraged as per our guidelines above. These topics are popular, but every year we will be receiving more submissions about them than we can accept.
