### Special Visibility Packages
With each of these sponsor options, we will make sure the attendees know you sponsored the
event by providing the opportunity to associate your brand with a high-visibility activity during
the event. There will be up-front announcements of these events, social media, website
promotion and, of course, your logo or pop-up banner will be incorporated in some fashion
(depends on option).
Each of these are unique opportunities and are available on a first-come / first served basis.
When we run out, we have run out!

* Caffeine: We plan to have a coffee cart to keep the audience caffeinated through the
event.
* Wireless Networking: Your company name will be the SSID for the network at the
conference.
* Ice Cream Social/Smoothie: During our afternoon break on day 1, we will have an ice
cream social featuring Little Man Ice Cream.
* Dessert/Cupcake Break: During our afternoon break on day 2, we will have a little
dessert social.
