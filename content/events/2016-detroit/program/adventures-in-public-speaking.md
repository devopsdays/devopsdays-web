**Speaker**: Leon Fayer, OmniTI

Lately, I've been having a lot of conversations with conference goers.  Most
attend numerous conferences, have great hallway discussions and yet, are too
hesitant to submit a proposal with their story.  The reasons vary, but the
hesitation (or even fear) to present a topic publicly is pretty common in our
industry.  Being a fairly new speaker myself, I can relate to a lot of these
concerns.  Hence the reason for this talk.

This talk covers a few of the more common objections to public speaking,
recommendations on how to address them as well as tips for new (and maybe
veteran) speakers.  Everyone has a story.  That story should be heard.
