“Infrastructure as Code” as a tenet of DevOps is exciting to IT and Dev
organizations alike.  Imagine quickly and consistently building, tearing down,
and re-building whole test/dev/production environments in the public and/or
private cloud.  Create and apply a text file that quickly configures storage,
network, subnets, virtual machine NICs, firewall configurations, and virtual
machines; all in one operation!  In this session we’ll walk through the basics
of building and utilizing these JSON templates, both in plain text and when
driven through other tools such as Git, Git Hub, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code,
and Visual Studio.  This will be a demo-heavy session, leaving you with
examples and do-it-yourself homework to help you continue learning this very
useful new cloud-first engine.
