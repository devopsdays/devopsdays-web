**Speaker**: Mike Nguyen, GitHub

This talk will introduce attendees to Hubot, an open source robot who sits in
your company's chat client to help your developers by doing most of the heavy
lifting. We'll look at how he can bring GitHub and many core DevOps tools and
philosophies to developers' fingertips and why everyone on the team gains from
this benefit. We'll also see how easy it can be to configure Hubot to plug into
other tools and what results we can expect to see from using Hubot. By the end
of this session, we will have outlined why using Hubot is better for
individuals and teams, while increasing the speed to develop any of your
features.
