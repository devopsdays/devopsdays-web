I’d like to propose an Ignite that hits close to home for me.  I’ve been in App
Support for a number of years and I’ve dealt with a few common nightmares
associated with the roll.  The ignite goes over the top 5 nightmares an app
support engineer deals with and I give a bit of insight on how to better come
to grips on handling them.

-        What is this mysterious new app, and why is it broken at 3am?
-        Brace yourselves a new release is coming!
-        You did what to my server?
-        And more
