**Speaker**: Cassie DeWitt, Detroit Fire Department


Data science at the Detroit Fire Department utilizes an integration of
technology and data to problem solve and provide actionable insight in response
to several key issues. In the first half of my presentation, I cover *how* I have
utilized a combination of technology and data to lay the groundwork for a
successful data science program. During this part of my presentation, I
reference the partnerships, tools, and practices I have used to create a
foundation for data science at the Detroit Fire Department. In the second half
of my talk, I demonstrate *how* the Detroit Fire Department is utilizing this
foundation of data science, where analytics at DFD are headed, and a trajectory
I have charted for this direction. During the second half of my presentation, I
reflect upon the field of data science and, thereafter, posit that the field
needs to better ask questions that point to the betterment of the
organizations/departments that data scientists serve. In addition, I propose
that the field needs to better utilize technology, not as a productâ€”but as
something that helps the organizations and institutions that data scientist
serve better realize their mission and vision. Expounding upon this
bi-proposal, I explain how the Detroit Fire Department is utilizing these needs
into its evolving data science program.

integrates quantitative and spatial data analysis with technology and applied
research methodology. She utilizes this combination to identify and help solve
problems the Detroit Fire Department encounters in moving towards its strategic
vision. As the Lead Data Scientist at the Detroit Fire Department, she has
demonstrated a track record of producing actionable insight on building fire +
EMS incidents, response time analysis, and resource allocation. She
additionally manages the DFD Data Team, which comprises the Detroit Fire
Department and the Department of Innovation and Technology. Under her
leadership, the DFD Data Team oversees the Open Data Portal; reports
performance-based metrics to Commissioner Jones and Mayor Duggan; and oversees
data quality.

Previous to the role of Lead Data Scientist, Ms. DeWitt was a
Data Analyst under the former Executive Fire Commissioner Edsel Jenkins. From
2011 to 2012, she worked on several revitalization projects in the City of
