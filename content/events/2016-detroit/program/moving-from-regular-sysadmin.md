I was the regular enterprise sysadmin: network administrator & datacenter
systems engineer in an ISP, IT operation support administrator in a retail
company and IT systems engineer in a software development company. I spent time
on choosing cool names for my servers. I knew the exact location of a server in
the datacenter. I felt sad when their lights stopped blinking. I felt more sad
it that happened on a weekend night.
 
And then I joined a team adopting the DevOps mindset. Let me be honest: change
was scary! But it was also a great learning experience. This talk will share
what was challenging and what worked for me in my transition from being a
regular sysadmin to living and breathing DevOps.
