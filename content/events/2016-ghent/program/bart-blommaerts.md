  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Serverless as a Collaborative Economy enabler
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
In recent years, the uprise of the cloud has brought us a lot of new and disruptive technology. Everybody is talking about SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and other aaS’es. In 2014 Amazon launched AWS Lambda as the pinnacle of the cloud computing. It allows developers to focus on code, without spending time on managing servers. The goal of this talk is not only introducing the serverless architecture style, but also tackle popular myths regarding “No More Servers” and “No More Ops”. Throughout the talk, we will focus on a “collaborative economy” approach to explain these concepts.
