  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Deploy HA MySQL environment using Puppet and MySQL Group Replication
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
This talk is covering the automation of MySQL HA environment setup using Puppet. All members of the InnoDB Cluster will be replication from each other (no asyncrhonous master/slave replication anymore) using the new MySQL Group Replication. This replication is much easier to deploy than usual MySQL replication as every members are equals. We will use a dedicated puppet module and hiera to setup our environment and important decision and variables will be highlighted and explained. The session finishes with a full cluster deployment on Vagrant in 2 minutes.
