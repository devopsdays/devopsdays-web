Newborn baby as a production system
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
When my wife told me she was pregnant I was scared of the new responsibility, and was certain I would screw it up. This is how I dealt with it by reframing the problem. I shall draw comparisons between caring for a newborn baby and a production system, including analytics, hacks etc.

Rinse and repeat - is giving the same talk again ok?</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
We all go to conferences and hear pretty much more of the same. Yet another talk about microservices\docker\etc. But are these really the same talks? is this a simple rehash, or rather evolution?
