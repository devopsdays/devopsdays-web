  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Why and how bookkeepers f***d up IT
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>
How the financial organisation of companies make people work inefficient, and create frustration? Is it another way?
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
This talk is about how financially minded management of companies lead to split the IT management into several business units, each with its own goals and management. This split creates misalignment and conflicts between teams that were supposed to work together.

This talk is a toolbox designed to help you bring proper implementation of devops and to make people work together on a common goal: efficient automatisation and use of the human brain power geared towards making IT an asset instead of a cost center.
