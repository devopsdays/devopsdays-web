  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Driving Technical Change
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Ever been to a conference, get inspired, try to bring what you learned back to the office, only to be stymied by co-workers who aren’t interested in rocking the status quo? It turns out that people tend to resist change in patterns, and like any pattern they can be overcome by using other people’s experiences with those skeptics. This session will teach you how to identify the skeptics, how to counter them, and give you a strategic framework to convince your whole office.
