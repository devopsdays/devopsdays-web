**Abstract:**

Although the DevOps itself is more about cultural change in IT rather than technology stack, right tooling is also crucial for successful DevOps adaptation and PaaS platforms are one of the most important enabler tools of DevOps. Red Hat's open source technology OpenShift is one the leading technology in PaaS landscape that uses Docker containers as deployment units and Kubernetes as orchestration technology. OpenShift itself sits on top of those technologies and adds seamless & painless developer user experience for both developers and operations. It offers application management at scale, source code management, CI/CD processes, team collaboration and organization, self-service capabilities. In my presentation I'll briefly introduce Docker container technology and ways of orchestrating containers with Kubernetes at enterprise scale, benefits of OpenShift to boost up development lifecycle and also give an example demonstration of developing micro service applications with automated CI/CD pipeline.
