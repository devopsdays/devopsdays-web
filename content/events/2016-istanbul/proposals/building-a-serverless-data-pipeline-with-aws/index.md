**Abstract:**

Collecting web data for both real-time and batch analytics is a common problem. Of course, there are many ways to solve it, but they often require a lot of complex IT plumbing which creates even more issues around scalability, reliability, performance and monitoring. Wouldn’t you rather spend time working on your business projects, creating value for your company and your customers ? The purpose of this presentation is to show you how you can quickly build such a pipeline, using a serverless architecture based on highly available, highly scalable AWS managed services… and very little code. After a brief introduction to AWS Lambda, we’ll build the pipeline step by step, using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, DynamoDB streams, Kinesis Firehose, CloudWatch Events and S3. And of course, we’ll run some tests !
