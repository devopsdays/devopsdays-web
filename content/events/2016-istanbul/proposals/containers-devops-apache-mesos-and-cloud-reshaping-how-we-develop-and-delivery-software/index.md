**Abstract:**

Container technology are being evaluated by software developers and administrators with a great deal of interest. Developers want to focus on what they do best: Creating and coding new applications. That shouldn't have to change just because they need to deploy an application to a different environment. Administrators want the environment to stay reliable and stable, keeping changes at a minimum. By following a strategy that embraces good Architecture, use of Containers, DevOps philosophy, Apache Mesos and a Cloud based environment, developers and operators can create, consume and collaborate on the infrastructure configuration over the time, deploy Java EE applications and test your application infrastructure consistently regardless of the stage of the development life cycle.
