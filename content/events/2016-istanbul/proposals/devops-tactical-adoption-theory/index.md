**Abstract:**

DevOps is a state of art describing each software development step as a repeatable, automatable and deterministic process excluding error-prone human factor first time in the history of software development. The model defines the entire value chance from concept to concrete product. It is an evolutionary end for the models of software development and agile movement. But, there is a problem with the concept; though described easily, implemented a little hard.

DevOps Tactical Adoption Theory tries to make the transition process as smooth as possible. It hypothesis each step towards DevOps maturity should bring a visible business value empowering management and team commitment for the next step. The innovative idea here, it is not required to add the tools/processes to stack from sequential beginning to end, but seeking benefit.

The reason behind the theory is to encourage practitioners to apply each step one-by-one and then having the benefits in projects. Consequently, each step is tested in terms of utility and proved method validity for the further steps. In contrast to previous adoption models, for example the one publish by Inedo[1], our model indicates concrete activities rather than general statements. 

Theory built on the claim that many DevOps transition projects considered problematic, impractical or even unsuccessful causing concept to become a goal more than a technique. Basically, theory consists of different areas of interest describing various actions on a schema.

In the session, it is planned to demonstrate “Tactical DevOps Adoption Theory” with focus on Testing Practices sectioned "Continuous Testing in DevOps".
