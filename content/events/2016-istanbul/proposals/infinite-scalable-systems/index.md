**Abstract:**

I want to talk about Infinite Scalable Systems with Docker, Docker Swarm, and Docker Machine. In this session I will mention about Docker and history of containerization technology. I will also mention about Docker Machine to create machines along the cloud providers and then use Docker Swarm to setup native clustering beside those machines. At the end of session, I will show a quick demo.

**Speaker:**
HÃ¼seyin BABAL
