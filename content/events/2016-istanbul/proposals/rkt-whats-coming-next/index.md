**Abstract:**

rkt is the next-generation container manager for Linux clusters. Designed for security, simplicity, and composability within modern cluster architectures, rkt discovers, verifies, fetches, and executes application containers with pluggable isolation.

After 1.0 rkt has continued changing a lot, and judging by the amount of changes in the last months, it doesn't show signs of stopping! Come and learn what’s new in the rkt world, what challenges did we face recently and what are the plans for the future. 

The talk will include a brief introduction to rkt so don't hesitate to come even if you know nothing about it or about Linux containers in general.
