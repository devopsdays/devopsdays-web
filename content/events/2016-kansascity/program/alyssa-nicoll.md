  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Innovating is not about technology, but psychology.
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Why do we do it? Why do we try so hard? Why are we paying to be here, to listen to people talk? Maybe because weâ€™re life long learners - we want to learn new things? Commune with our own kind? But why? Come examine our motives as developers, the pitfalls we fall into, and the cost of being great.
