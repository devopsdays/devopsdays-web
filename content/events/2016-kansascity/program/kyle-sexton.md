  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Introduction to Habitat
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
A quick introduction / live demo of Habitat (www.habitat.sh) and how it fits into the current DevOps landscape.  I will discuss some of the concepts Habitat brings such as "packaging the automation with the application" and how those concepts differ from other approaches.
