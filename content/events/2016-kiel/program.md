<h2>Talk descriptions and Speaker bios</h2>

<div id="desc1"><h3>From 0 to DevOps - Coping with Continuous Delivery to the Cloud by Oliver Siebenmarck</h3>

<p>"Hey, we're doing this really cool new platform and it will be run in the cloud. The team is international and everything will be DevOps. Interested?"
"Sure!"</p>

<p>And so, a tale of woe begins. Not because DevOps is hard, but because it has to be learned to be done right. By the young talents as well as the old guard. Mistakes were made, misunderstandings were common, shouting matches only avoided by the low quality of some telephone lines.
So, how come that in the end it all worked out? That people like each other, that everyone kept their sanity and that the portal went live in time and with good quality.</p>

<p>This talk will give a detailed report on the lessons learned by a diverse project team that tried to do everything right while keeping deadlines. Insights include managing a geographically diverse team, when to use automation and how to make sure that tech and people play nice.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/siebenmarck">Oliver</a> happily works as a consultant for IBM, with a focus on all topics cloud and innovation in IT. He has a keen interest in application lifecycle management and the question of how people can best work together on a project. Oliver lives and codes in Kiel, Germany.

<div id="desc2"><h3>ITIL and DevOps can be friends by Jan-Joost Bouwman</h3>

<p>ING is a worldwide financial institution, based in the Netherlands. The IT department of the Netherlands manages a mix of off the shelf applications and in house built software. Traditionally development was governed by CMMi and IT Servicemanagement by ITIL processes. Three years ago the developers started working in Agile/Scrum teams, dropping CMMi. The next step was to involve Operations as well and transform to an DevOps organisation, striving for Continuous Delivery.
</p><p>
In a lot of Agile organisations ITIL is considered the evil soul sucking epiphany of bureaucracy. But is it really? If we look at the tasks you perform in the ITIL processes Incident management, Problem management and Change management, you will find that a lot of those you still need to perform in an Agile/Scrum way of work. And that there actually is a lot of value in making some rules on how we want to interact in these processes between teams. But we may call the task differently than we were used to in ITIL. And we may choose to use different tools to handle parts of the process. We call this adaptation of ITIL Agile ITSM.
</p><p>
This talk focuses on the adaptations we have made to our ITSM processes to accommodate the requirements of an Agile/Scrum way of work. Proving that there is still value in a lot of the things we used to do in ITIL And that there is no real conflict between Agile and ITIL.
</p><p>
<strong>Speaker</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/janjoostbouwman">Jan-Joost</a> stumbled into IT almost 20 years ago, starting on a temp job for 5 days that lasted 7 years. During those years he has been mostly on the functional/process side of things, having worked as tester, designer, information analyst, project manager, application manager, change manager and currently as process owner the ITIL change management process at ING.
</p><p>
He is also the self appointed DevOps evangelist and community leader there, trying to help his co-workers to make the transition to DevOps and Continuous Delivery and have fun with it at the same time!
</p><p>
In his spare time he enjoys travelling the world to watch birds, or cooking, but rarely at the same time.

<div id="desc3"><h3>Continuous Testing for DevOps: Evolving Beyond Automation by Wayne Ariola</h3>
<p>
Attend this session to learn why and how Continuous Testing's real-time objective assessment of an application's business risks is a critical component of DevOps:
</p><p>
Throughout the process, business stakeholders have instant access to feedback on whether their expectations are being met, enabling them to make informed decisions.
</p><p>
At the time of the critical "go/no go" decision, there is an instant, objective assessment of whether your organization's specific expectations are satisfied--reducing the business risk of a fully-automated Continuous Delivery process.
</p><p>
Defects are eliminated at the point when they are easiest, fastest, and least costly to fix--a prime principle of being "lean."
</p><p>
Continuous measurement vs. key metrics means continuous feedback, which can be shared and used to refine the process.
</p><p>

<div id="desc4"><h3>Learning to fall by Rafael Ördög</h3>
<p>
When people talk about advantages of microservices, easy scaling and resilience comes up frequently. What they don't usually tell you, is that robustness does not come for free. If you don't put extra effort into gracefully failing when one of your dependencies is down, microservices will only make your system even more brittle.
</p><p>
In my presentation I will recount our journey from an instabile monolith to a robust set of microservices with a special focus on architectural patterns that helped us along the way.
</p><p>
<strong>Speaker</strong>

<div id="desc8"><h3>The Challenges of Adopting DevOps by Bianca Heinemann</h3>
<p>
A lot of companies underestimate the amount of change that adopting DevOps brings to the organization. What are the challenges for a company going DevOps? What should be expected in the realms of tools, methods and even culture? This presentation will try to shed some light on what is going to happen after someone says, "Let's do this DevOps thing.

<div id="desc9"><h3>Docker Container Lifecycles - Problem or Opportunity? by Baruch Sadogursky</h3>
<p>
Docker is hot. However, as Docker container use spreads into more mature production pipelines, there can be issues about control of Docker images to ensure they are production-ready.  Is a promotion-based model appropriate to control and track the flow of Docker images from development to production?
We will demonstrate how to implement a promotion model for docker images, and then show how to distribute them to any kind of consumer, being it a customer or a data center.

<div id="desc11"><h3>Rethinking Performance Engineering in the DevOps World by Felix Willnecker/André van Hoorn</h3>
<p>
Researchers and practitioners know quite well how to handle performance in classical environments involving a strict separation between Dev and Ops. DevOps aims to merge these silos. So far, the community has failed to systematically integrate performance management practices into the DevOps world, even though modern software development paradigms provide great opportunities to do that. Only holistic performance management, integrating Dev and Ops throughout the whole life-cycle, leads to high-quality software.
</p><p>
We have developed a blueprint for performance-aware DevOps processes and infrastructures, serving as a template for holistic performance management. The design rationale for this blueprint has been accompanied by an industry survey ascertaining current practices and tools. The blueprint is a result of a joint work by multiple institutions. This talk will outline the blueprint and give the opportunity to exchange views among DevOps-enthusiastic researchers and practitioners.
</p><p>

<div id="desc12"><h3>Working in and with Open Source Communities by Bernd Erk</h3>
<p>
Starting an open source project is very easy, especially in the days of GitHub. Push your code and see if somebody is interested in. If you are able to gain attention and interest for you project you feel motivated and work all night long. But on the other hand, people will start complaining about open bugs, missing features and your evil or non existing website. Believe it or not, but this will pursue you until your last user dies.
</p><p>
One of the most important things for a successful open source project is to treat you community well. This talk will share some experiences made during the last 6 years with Icinga. Starting with basic concepts, it deals with tools and methods helping to increase and cultivate your community. It also covers internal organisation requirements for successful community work and upcoming challenges if you strike some new paths with your project.
</p><p>
<strong>Speaker</strong>
</p><p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/gethash">Bernd Erk</a> is co-founder and community manager of the Icinga Project.

<div id="desc15"><h3>The (Un)Surprising Truth About DevOps Culture by Manuel Pais</h3>
<p><code>&lt;irony&gt;</code>Yes, this talk will tell you about all the right practices you need to adopt to become a successful DevOps organization!<code>&lt;/&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>&lt;bummer&gt;</code>DevOps is highly contextual, there is no set of prescribed practices an enterprise can pick up and "become DevOps".<code>&lt;/&gt;</code></p>

<p>However, healthy organizations exhibit similar organizational and behavioral patterns that help them continuously learn and become better places to work while outperforming competitors.</p>

<p>In this talk we explore some of those patterns, why they might help in certain contexts while they might hurt in others.</p>

<p>We will also look at some surprising results from community-driven research on which practices contribute the most towards an environment of collaboration, sharing and ownership (of both successes and failures). In other words, what moves the needle towards DevOps? Is it infrastructure-as-code? Devs on-call? Blameless post-mortems?</p>

<p>Attend this ignite talk and get ready to be surprised!</p>

<div id="desc17"><h3>DevOps and sharing</h3>
<p>Tools aren't everything in DevOps, DevOps is also - if not mostly - about people. That's a truism... or is it? Even the best tools won't help you when you've got years of valuable knowledge stuck in the heads of long-term employees. Once you start digging, you'll be surprised how much of that knowledge is creating unnecessary bottlenecks. Some of your team mates even end up re-inventing the wheel. Don't be surprised if a lot of your time spent on restructuring an organization focuses on running from desk to desk and taking notes!
</p><p>
In this talk we will look into the whys and hows of using so-called people skills. Why are they so important to maintain a healthy company culture? How can we facilitate sharing?
</p>
