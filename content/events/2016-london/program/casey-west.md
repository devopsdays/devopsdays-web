## Minimum Viable Platform: The 6 Characteristics of Operationally Mature Production Environments

Operational maturity for a distributed-systems production environment requires a
clear understanding of the 6 high-level characteristics common to
operationally mature production environments:</P>
<UL>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Routing
        and load balancing</P>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Backing
        services broker</P>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Infrastructure
        orchestration</P>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Health
        management, monitoring and recovery</P>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Immutable
        artefact repository</P>
        <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Log
        aggregation</P>
</UL>

In this interactive talk, we will explore the critical capabilities necessary to create a mature production platform with these charac
teristics. We will present these capabilities in the form of a useful rubric for you to create your own Minimum Viable Platform effect
ively.

What's more, you will gain insights on what life is like in the day-of-the-life of teams who have the operational maturity of a Minimu
m Viable Platform.
