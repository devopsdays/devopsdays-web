## Agile your ITIL - Bringing DevOps Benefits to IT Service Management

Many large financial enterprises have spent years implementing frameworks, standards and methodologies to try and get IT 'right'. One of the most commonly adopted of these is ITIL, enabling organisations to put in place fundamental processes such as incident management and change management.
The result of implementing of ITIL may lead to IT staff feeling overloaded and resist DevOps initiatives because they've only just 'finished' ITIL. What's more, the problem is that ITIL is typically restricted to operations while agile thinking remains exclusively limited within IT development.
In this talk, we will focus on bringing elements of agile thinking to IT service management to provide the benefits of DevOps without overwhelming an organisation and its staff. In particular, we will be looking at ways to unite dev and ops, apply agile thinking to ITSM processes and redefine what we mean by 'service' and 'product'. The result will be a better understanding of how to adopt DevOps in large organisation by evolution, not revolution.
