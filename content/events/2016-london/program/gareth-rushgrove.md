## Rate of Change, (Un)opinionated Platforms and Devops Coevolution

There has been a recent explosion in new technologies for running software systems.

Many architectures are now based on ever smaller (micro) services.

The devops movement has crossed the chasm and become mainstream with operators and developers working more closely together than ever before.

These three threads are the result of coevolution - where a change in one practice has a direct effect on others.

Join us to gain insights on how the adoption of practices such as devops and microservices, and tools such as platform as a service, are interconnected. You'll also develop a better understanding of how devops emerged in widely different organisations. Last, but by no means least, we'll explore the power of coevolution which makes cause and effect bi-directional, making it possible to leverage what you do and how you do it to improve your organisation as a whole.
