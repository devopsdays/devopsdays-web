## My Top Five Lessons Learned: DevOps In Large, Complex Organizations

For me, nothing inspires more awe and more learning than studying how large, complex organizations that have been around for decades, or even centuries, are mobilizing around DevOps and getting the same amazing outcomes that we typically see in organizations like Amazon, Google, Netflix and Etsy. They are elevating the state of the engineering practice in organizations that often have thousands of development, test and operations engineers, improving organizational outcomes and making work more humane and fun.

I can’t wait to share with the DevOpsDays community what I’ve learned, share the problem roadmap that’s been verbalized, and some of the things we’ve been working on to help people overcome those problems!

See you there!
