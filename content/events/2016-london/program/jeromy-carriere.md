## Enterprise Ops Rising

As enterprise organisations move to the cloud they are faced with numerous operational and security challenges. First, they need to manage and monitor large numbers of systems and microservices. Second, they need to ensure proper application functioning and compliance with relevant standards. Last, but by no means least, they need to do all of that in a hybrid model - bridging across infrastructure platforms and legacy applications.
In this session, we will look at the changing requirements, opportunities, and challenges for the DevOps community as enterprises move to the cloud. In particular, we will examine the intersection of ops and governance and how we see practices evolving there as well as where gaps remain. We will conclude with insights from Google's own experience deploying applications on its cloud platform.
