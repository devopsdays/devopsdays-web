## We are Great at DevOps but the Enterprise is Failing

DevOps and Continuous Delivery (CD) allow us to deliver IT services and products faster and more reliable than product owners ever dreamed of. However, many enterprise management processes and practices are barricades that require dismantling to gain maximum benefit from this capability. In this session, we will talk about legacy management practices in Finance, IT Governance and Procurement and how they inhibit our ability to extend the benefits and create more value to our customers when we embrace DevOps and CD. We will provide examples from large enterprises that demonstrate how we can use Lean Thinking and Principles to break down these management barricades and deliver even more value to our customers.
