## From Lean in Automative to Lean IT

There is much we can learn from Lean in the automative industry, dating back to Henry Ford and Toyota and looking forward to the now more modern iterations and implementation of Lean.

In this talk, we will revisit fundamental Lean concepts and principles applicable to IT and explore how they can be applied to improve our organisations. The topics we will cover include Total Quality Management, organisation optimisation, simplification and improved time-to-market.
