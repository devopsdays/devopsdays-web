## Inside Microsoft Engineering: DevOps Lessons Learned

Many Microsoft teams are embracing organisational changes and culture shifts necessary for adopting DevOps including teams responsible for delivering Bing, PowerBI, Azure, Visual Studio, MSN and Microsoft Developer Network.

In this session, we will share with you a multitude of DevOps transformation stories among the teams and provide details of their transformations, ranging from shifts in roles and accountabilities to mindset changes and metrics. We will also provide recommendations based on lessons learned and what we would do differently if we could do it again.
