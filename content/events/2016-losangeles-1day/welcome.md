<b>DevOps Days is returning to Los Angeles!</b>

Dates: January 22nd, 2016

We are proud to announce 6th Annual DevOps Day LA, to be held Friday, January 22, 2016, co-located
with <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org">SCALE 14x</a>, at the Pasadena Convention Center.
<br/>

DevOps Day LA is a single day event dedicated to the DevOps community, and professionals who wish
to improve the interaction and integration between these traditional silos of Development and
Operations. We're looking for speakers interested in presenting to this forum. The theme for the
conference this year is <strong>"Surprise!"</strong>, a phrase that all too often fills devops
teams with dread, but can also be positive.<br/>
