  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Leaving an Open Source Project
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
In the professional world when you decide to leave your job there is a whole process. Traditionally you’ll begin to transition tasks you worked on to another employee, your various accounts are terminated, you’ll go through an exit interview and then receive your final paycheck before being escorted from the building. But what happens when you decide to leave an open source project? Are you no longer a member of that community simply because you’re no longer actively contributing? Can you easily come back to the project? This talk will hopefully answer these and other questions.
