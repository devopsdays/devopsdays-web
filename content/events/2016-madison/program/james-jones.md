  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Why Superior Technologies Fail
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Superior technology does not sell itself. Transformations to your organization’s IT processes won’t happen by itself either. Tying all of potential value back to the business is a key part of getting buy in from upper management and can help solidify your value to the organization.
