  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Creative & Tech - A Partnership
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
The premise that dev and ops are at odds is a fallacy. These groups naturally align because they share a problem solving approach. My organization is driven by creativity, and it takes more than aligned incentives to create high-functioning teams. Iâ€™ll talk about the journey to empathy and trust.
