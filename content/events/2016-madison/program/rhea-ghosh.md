  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
From Databases to DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
I came to DevOps from being a DBA, which is one of the most resistant IT groups to automation. My talk will focus on how the journey I took was supported by management cultures and team cultures that foster individual growth and help increase and sustain diversity on DevOps teams.
