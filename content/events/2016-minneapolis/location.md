The conference will take place Wednesday July 20 and Thursday July 21, 2016 at the <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/hilton-minneapolis-MSPMHHH/index.html">downtown Minneapolis Hilton</a>. The Hilton has very few hotel rooms available, but there are many other hotels nearby.
<p>
Last year, we worked with the hotel to make space available for nursing mothers, and if that would be useful for you, please let us know. We'd also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs. You can reach out <a href="http://www.devopsmsp.org/slack/">on devops MSP Slack</a> or via <a href="mailto:organizers-minneapolis-2016@devopsdays.org">email</a>.
<p>
The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="http://www.metrotransit.org/airport.aspx">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. You can walk (under a mile), transfer to a free bus on the bus/bike/pedestrian Nicollet Mall in downtown, or take a short cab ride from the LRT. Uber & Lyft are also available, as is car2go.
<p>

If you spend most of your time in places like Portland or Brooklyn, our metro will feel familiar, with its bike share stations, beautiful riverfront, and numerous craft brewery tap-rooms with food trucks in their parking lots.
