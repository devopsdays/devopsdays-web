  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Your Meetings Are Unbearable: Cheat Codes From Occupy
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Most work meetings are full of interruptions, repetitions and microaggressions. To make matters worse, they always seem to drag on forever.  At Occupy, ain't nobody got time for that, so we adapted time-tested anarchist techniques and came up with a simple, efficient horizontal decision-making process.  I would like to show you the hand gestures that go with these techniques; these alone are guaranteed to cut your meeting times in half and save 72% of your sanity.
