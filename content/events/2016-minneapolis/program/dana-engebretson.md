  HealthOps in Team Chat

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
I wanted to learn google cloud deployment with docker and kubernetes so that I can be more useful to my team. I picked a small side project that would be fun, could benefit my team, and was manageable to fail at without slowing anyone down. I made someone’s slackbot exercise trainer more polite and added cute gifs of baby animals for intermittent reinforcement. Now I’ve gained my team’s trust to deploy our much bigger project to gcloud.
