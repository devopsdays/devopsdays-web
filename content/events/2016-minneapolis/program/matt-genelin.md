  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Updating Classic Workplace Sabotage Techniques
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
In 1944, the Office of Strategic Services—the predecessor of the post-war CIA—was concerned with sabotage directed against enemies of the US military. Among their ephemera, declassified and published today by the CIA, is a fascinating document called the Simple Sabotage Field Manual (PDF). It's not just about blowing things up; a lot of its tips are concerned with how sympathizers with the allied cause can impair enemy material production and morale.
