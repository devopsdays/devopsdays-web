  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
The Data on DevOps: Making the Case for Awesome
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
What’s the value proposition of DevOps? Does culture change show up in the bottom line? What practices predict high IT performance? We hear many stories to inspire and inform us, but the plural of anecdote is not data. Let’s dive into the research and find out which DevOps practices drive optimal IT and business outcomes.
</p>

<p>
The data shows that the best IT performers have the highest throughput and reliability while contributing to organizational profitability, productivity, and market share goals. Industry trends around security, containers, continuous delivery, and lean management relate to IT performance and quality: let’s talk about how.
</p>

<p>
Management and practitioners alike will leave with a better understanding of how to achieve the best outcomes, while armed with the data they need to make the case for change.
