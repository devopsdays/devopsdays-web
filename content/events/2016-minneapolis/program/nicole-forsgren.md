</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
What’s the value proposition of DevOps? Does culture change show up in the bottom line? What practices predict high IT performance? We hear many stories to inspire and inform us, but the plural of anecdote is not data. Let’s dive into the research and find out which DevOps practices drive optimal IT and business outcomes.

Industry trends around security, containers, continuous delivery, and lean management relate to IT performance and quality: let’s talk about how.
</p>
