  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Working in and with Open Source Communities
  </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Starting an open source project is very easy, especially in the days of GitHub. Push your code and see if somebody is interested in. If you are able to gain attention and interest for you project you feel motivated and work all night long. But on the other hand, people will start complaining about open bugs, missing features and your evil or non existing website. Believe it or not, but this will pursue you until your last user dies.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important things for a successful open source project is to treat you community well. This talk will share some experiences made during the last 6 years with Icinga. Starting with basic concepts, it deals with tools and methods helping to increase and cultivate your community. It also covers internal organisation requirements for successful community work and upcoming challenges if you strike some new paths with your project.
