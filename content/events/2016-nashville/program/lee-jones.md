The ideas and tools within the DevOps community are increasing and evolving each day. The pace is fast and only seems to be getting faster.

Continuous improvement provides a mindset for approaching this ongoing challenge. At its core, continuous improvement is a way to focus on getting a little better each day. In this talk we will dive into practical techniques like removing mental overhead through fixing what bugs you. We will look at developing deep focus as a critical skill for problem solving. We will also explore some learning techniques that will allow us to approach new tools and ideas with confidence and effectiveness.
