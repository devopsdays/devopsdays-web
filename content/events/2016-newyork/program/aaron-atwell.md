  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Don't Believe the Data! Data VS Intuition in Decision Making
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
We are inundated with more and more data everyday. From system notifications, to alerts, SMS, to push, we're constantly notified of things happening. Additionally we're having to take more and more data into consideration in order to make a proper decision. When working in a business critical alerting environment where decisions can cost 1,000's of dollars in a matter of minutes, how do you take in all the data from multiple alerts and balance that data against what your 'gut' tells you?  We'll look at how our brains process information, go back in time to look at our primitive brains, and use some insights about our modern brains to help provide some guidance on how to make that critical decision under pressure!
