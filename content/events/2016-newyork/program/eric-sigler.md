  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
3AM, a survey.
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
3AM sure does seem to get a lot of flack. It's the timeframe of choice for horror stories of ailing infrastructure, broken backups, and overly caffeinated engineers.  How often does 3AM get thrown under the bus?  This tongue-in-cheek lightning talk will take a look at all of the ways that 3AM seems to get referenced both inside and outside of of the technology industry.  Graphs may be involved, but not willingly.
