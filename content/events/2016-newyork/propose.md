<b>Ignite talks</b>
<br>
Want to be part of devopsdays New York? Got something to say? Can you say it in five minutes? Any topic is fair game as long as it’s something you’re passionate about - this could be a side-project, a unique hobby, a hilarious work story, or an awesome idea that just isn't 30 minutes long. Speakers are limited to exactly 20 slides which auto-advance every 15 seconds. Sound like fun? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sMSUMupY-1OrP6Vykj9V18CAkhK6LkXn7QyHfTByn9E/viewform">Submit your Ignite</a> now (or by July 15th)! We'll publish the 10 Ignite talks we've selected by August 10th.

<b>30 minute talks</b>
<br>
If you want to be an even bigger part of devopsdays New York, you should submit a 30 minute talk! This year we want to capture the breadth and diversity of ideas and experiences in the devops space - we encourage people with unique viewpoints, diverse perspectives, and stories that haven't been told before to submit and share their experiences with us. Talks will not be limited to strictly development or operations perspectives. If you have something to say that you think will be interesting to a wide range of technologists, you should <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sMSUMupY-1OrP6Vykj9V18CAkhK6LkXn7QyHfTByn9E/viewform">submit a 30 minute talk</a> now (or by July 15th)! We will notify all submitters by August 10th.

<b>Open Space breakout sessions</b>
<br>
If you'd like to lead a group discussion during the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions, it is not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in person at the conference. If you'd like to demo your product or service, you should <a href="/events/2016-newyork/sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and demo it at your table.

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We prefer talks not already presented at another event, especially another one in the local area or one available in recorded form.
- _no third-party submissions_: If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process. This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.


If your employer does not cover travel expenses you incur as a speaker at devopsdays New York, the conference can and will help; all speakers receive free conference tickets and we can provide financial assistance for travel and lodging expenses for 30 minute speakers upon request.
