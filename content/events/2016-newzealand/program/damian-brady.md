  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Just let me do my job!
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Working with other people sucks sometimes.

<p>You're employed to get things done. So is everyone else in the company. But despite being "on the same team", everyone has their own idea of priorities, urgent tasks, and tasks they consider a waste of time. Different teams and departments have different goals, and when they clash, it slows everyone down and can be frustrating and demotivating. So what's the solution? How can you convince everyone to just let you do your job?</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll share some practical changes you can make to help fix this problem. Backed up by both research and personal experience, these tips will help you to avoid frustrations and focus on what you're employed to do. We'll discuss topics like wasteful meetings, interruptions, unplanned work, frequently changing priorities, and menial tasks. From small changes in your own team, to ways to influence large cultural changes, there's something here for everyone.</p>
