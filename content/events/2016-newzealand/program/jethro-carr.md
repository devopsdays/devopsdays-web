  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Powering stuff.co.nz with DevOps goodness
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
A large site like www.stuff.co.nz has piles of systems and technologies in use. In this talk we try to give you a taster of the various technologies we use and their capabilities. What are we doing with Varnish? Lambda? Newrelic? AWS? Codeship? The goal of this is to give you some ideas of what goes into a large site from a technology perspective and how these technologies are useful tools for a DevOps toolkit at scale.
