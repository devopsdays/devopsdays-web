  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Deepening people to weather the org
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Devops is about changing technical culture. But technical culture isnt created in a vacuum  it's nurtured and reinforced by the broader organisational culture our tech orgs are part of.</p>

<p>That culture comes from people  our artifacts, beliefs, and assumptions. Unless we deepen our people's skills, knowledge, and experience, we'll get the culture change we deserve.</p>

<p>What does technical culture change look like, and how does it survive? And why are people the hardest but most important piece of the puzzle to change?</p>
