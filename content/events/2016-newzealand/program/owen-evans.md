  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
DevOps is dead, long live DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>DevOps, the term came from a need to classify a newer breed of developers in existing organisations, developers that refused to agree to an us than them mentality, that refused to fracture the tech teams of organisations based on if you worked on servers and infrastructure (Ops) vs if you wrote the client facing applications. With the birth of mainstream SaaS and Product Teams we had to tear down these walls, we had to make a stand.</p>

<p>This is the end of the beginning, were moving in to a new age of developers, were all devops now.</p>
