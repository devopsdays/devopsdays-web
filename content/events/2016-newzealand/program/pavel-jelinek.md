  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Kubernetes in Production
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>In **Movio** (NZ Hi-tech Awards 2016 Winners)  we love **microservices in Docker**. But when you have a few hundreds of them how do you effectively manage them? How do you update them with zero downtime? How do you make them HA and scale them? How do you monitor and troubleshoot services running in a cluster? In this presentation you can see a real world example how to achieve all that with **open source cluster** management tool called **Kubernetes**. Apart from microservices I will also show you how to deploy tools like **Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Cassandra** in the same cluster and benefit from the centralised features.</p>
