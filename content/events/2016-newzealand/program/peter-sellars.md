  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Culture As Strategy
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>DevOps is something we are, not something we do! Culture plays a significant role in our ability to continuously improve both ourselves and others. Creating a Strategy based on Culture as experienced in Deliberately Developmental Organisations (DDOs) provides an environment for continual growth.</p> 

<p>People are encouraged to expose their 'backhands', seek support and help and expect to help others work on their 'backhands' every day. Growth does not compete with business goals it is seen as a vital contributor to the business objectives. Why is Culture so important? How does a focus on Culture as Strategy provide an environment in which businesses can thrive and even exceed business expectations.</p>

<p>The time has come for Culture as Strategy!</p>
