DevOps is all about Continuous Improvement - but what is meant by this?  What are we improving?  Why do we want to continuously improve?  

How do we continuously improve, when we have to deal with incumbent technologies, increased learning curves and ever-increasing business demand for new features?

Technology is continuously changing, and the pace is only accelerating; there is no evidence of a plateau or slow-down any time soon.  Therefore, there are new opportunities emerging all the time - activities that were previously done manually are now automated, and this automation is increasing in sophistication.

So, is improvement then all about tools and technologies?  Or the people (as individuals and teams) that use them?  Or is it about organisations having the right investment in processes that support continuous improvement?

At the 2016 DevOpsDays NZ conference we hope to cover all these aspects and answer the 'what, why and how' of improvement in any organisation that uses IT as part of its business.
