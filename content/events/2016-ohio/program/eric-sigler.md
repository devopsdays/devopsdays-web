  <p><strong>Title: Humans are terrible compilers: A User's Guide
</strong>

</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>Humans are well known for their ability to be adaptable, flexible, and improvise as needed. However, they are often used as very oddly behaved compilers of written documents - run books for services, legal agreements, and pull requests / code reviews are a few examples.</p>

<p>This talk will cover several known issues with the current release of the Human 1.0 compiler, practical workarounds for these issues than anyone can use, and ways to debug when everything goes wrong.</p>
