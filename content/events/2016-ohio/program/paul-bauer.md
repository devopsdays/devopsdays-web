  <p><strong>Title: Deep Visibility in Production</strong>

</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Trendy architectures often leave much to be desired in the way of operational visibility. Containers, unikernels, serverless - all of these promise DevOps nirvana but their promises often fall far short when it comes to operational needs in production. Chanting "cattle not pets" every time we shoot a cow in the head will ruin us if the herd is sick and we're wearing a blindfold. How do we regain insight and deep visibility into our brave new containerized world?</p>
