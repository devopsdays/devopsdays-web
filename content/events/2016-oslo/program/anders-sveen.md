  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
DevOps - The Anti-patterns
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Organisations have been trying to implement DevOps for some time with varying results. I’ve been working to change a large organisation myself, not necessarily with the success I was hoping for. Through my own experiences and talking to people in other small and large organisations I’ve seen some common issues many struggle with. But when you try to find solutions to problems without taking a step back and looking at the root cause; you often end up fixing the wrong thing. Implementing anti-patterns and labelling it as DevOps. And the real issue is rarely technology.</p>

<p>In this talk I’ll tell you about why DevOps is so constrained by the organisation you are trying to introduce it in, and why human factors tend to trip things up. I’ll show some of the most common anti-patterns I’ve seen. Some consequences, and why they don’t work. You will probably recognise some of the patterns from your own organisation, but hopefully you can avoid some of them.</p>

<p>This talk will mostly be about the soft sides of DevOps. Technology is what I love to do. But using it to it’s full potential requires getting the most out of humans and organisations.</p>
