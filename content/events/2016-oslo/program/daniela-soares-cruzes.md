  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Communication in DevOps: A Fairy Tale or a Horror Story?
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Even though agile actively seeks collaboration from all its
stakeholders, most agile projects did not extend themselves toward the
operations people. DevOps came to bridge that gap. DevOps aligns business
requirements with IT performance, with the goal of adopting practices that
allow a quick flow of changes to a production environment, while
maintaining a high level of stability, reliability, and performance in
these systems. DevOps improves the work through a collection of principles
and practices, centered around close collaboration between Development and
Operations personnel. However, both sides have paid little, to none at
all, attention to issues faced by each other. When it comes down to sit
together and plan a solution to better meet customer demand, the
communication between Dev and Ops can go from a fairy tale for a horror
story with a blink of an eye. Many variables can affect this
communication, e.g., depending on the size of the team, people involved in
the conversation, how mature people are, location of the teams, means of
communication, etc. The main goal of our presentation is to shed some
lights on the perceptions that different teams have on communication in
DevOps, highlighting some of the bottlenecks that were brought to our
attention and share a list of some practices que might help your team to
achieve greatness together.</p>
