  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Devops is a Reorg
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Breaking down the silos between development and operations is the starting point for devops adoption, but is this sufficient ? For a number of organisations adopting devops really is a full reorganisation with a lot of team members getting new roles. This talk will guide you trough a number of these changes. What roles dissapear, what skills remain, but in a different role? This talk is based on real changes in actual large organisations. It will cover merging teams, relocating teams, changing the management of a team, the new role of architects, and much more. </p>
