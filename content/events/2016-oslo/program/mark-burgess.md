  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
How can we know if IT systems are working well?
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>
I will try to break down the learnings of 20 years of research, in IT operations, into a practical checklist of questions, under the umbrella of: can we promise a business or organization that its IT systems and services are working according to plan? The talk will touch on subjects like monitoring, policy, configuration, dependencies, scalability, and knowledge management.
