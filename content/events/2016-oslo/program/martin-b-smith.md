  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Reaping the rewards of remote-friendly DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>This talk will discuss some of the difficulties and benefits of being a remote worker on a DevOps team. I will tell the story of my experience of being a DevOps Engineer at Rackspace, fully remote, for the last 3 years. I will also talk about how I have been living the digital nomad lifestyle since January of 2016, as a participant in the Remote Year program, living and working with 75 remote workers across three continents, in a different city each month. With these two narratives, I will present tips & tricks, share failures & successes (especially how contributing to open source has been useful as a remote worker), and give attendees a list of concrete takeaways they can use to work smarter, work remotely, and be successful.</p>
