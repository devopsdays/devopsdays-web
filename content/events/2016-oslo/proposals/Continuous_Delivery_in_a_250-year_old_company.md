**Abstract:**
The literature and blogosphere around continuous delivery is littered with shining examples describing DevOps teams, container technologies, cloud platforms and green-field implementations. At Storebrand, our challenge was slightly different: We had an existing legacy of monolithic applications, cumbersome platforms, third-party operations teams, ITIL-heavy change processes and heavily orchestrated releases. We wanted something better, but could not throw away what we had and start again. Nor did we have any budgets or executive sponsors.

This talk will relay the story of how we moved into the world of continuous delivery one step at a time, without large rewrites or interruptions of ongoing projects. It will be a story of how ideal solutions seldom match the real-life requirements of an existing architecture, and how these can be overcome if you apply creativity, opportunism and a little bit of patience. We will also demonstrate how a loosely coupled and simplistic architecture can provide more flexibility than relying too much on a single tool or technology.

**Speaker:**
Terje LÃ¸ken is a former C++ programmer, Chief Architect and now unit manager for the "Digital & Mobile" unit @ Storebrand. His interests include distributed systems, evolving architectures and ways to make organizations and developers work smarter and faster.

He is also a fan of simplicity, grassroots activism and evolutionary change. He often considers patience, good timing and a keen sense of judgement equally important as technical mastery when evolving an architecture or bringing about change.
