title = "DevOps in the world of Software Defined Infrastructure"
+++

**Abstract:**
In recent years, infrastructure operations has gradually introduced concepts like Software Defined Storage, Software Defined Network, Network Function Virtualization and Converged Infrastructure.<br>
What will be the next phase of this evolution, and How does this impact the way we need to develop business and end-user applications?<br> 
The current growth in focus on Dev-Ops and Continuous Development/Delivery is enabled through an evolution in infrastructure operation and configuration. This means that, moving forward, software development needs to consider complexity and technical challenges that were previously left to Application Operations and Basic Operations of infrastructure services.<br>
This symbiosis of subject matters provides exciting opportunities, but also introduces a whole new field of subject matter expertise into software development and software management.<br>
The talk is intended as an eye opener for attendees by shedding light on the past, present and future characteristics of software development.<br>

**Speaker:**
Jason Diller has been working professionally in technology since the 90s. He has written code for numerous platforms from DOS to Windows to Linux to the Web. In recent years he's devoted his time to management and has a serious obsession with making his teams, people, and processes better. (A quest that will never be completed.) Currently he does so at PagerDuty.
