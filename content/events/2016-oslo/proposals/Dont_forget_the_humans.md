**Abstract:**
Well architected, modern infrastructure is as automated and self-managing as possible, but it still requires human operation for maintenance, upgrades and incident response. This talk will consider the human element and how humans should be considered a part of the system just like any other. It will propose several key principles concerning how systems should work alongside humans and give real world examples of how to implement them with war games and simulation training.

**Speaker:**
David Mytton is the founder of Server Density, a SaaS monitoring product. David has been programming in Python for 7+ years, having written the original monitoring agent code that now processes over 250TB/month of monitoring data from organisations such Boeing, Greenpeace and the UK’s NHS Ambulance Emergency Response.
