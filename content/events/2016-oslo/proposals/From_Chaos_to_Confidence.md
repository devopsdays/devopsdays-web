title = "From Chaos to Confidence - evolving our DevOps operating model at LeanKit"
+++

**Abstract:**
As a company, LeanKit have believed in Lean, Kanban, Agile, DevOps since our founding. We've alway talked about how important these ideas are - in the community and inside our company. But that doesn't mean that doing those things in practice has been easy. We're a very fast growing startup in a very competitive market space. We've tripled in size in less than a year and nearly came apart at the seams at times. In fact, in the fall of 2015, our technology team were having a very hard team. We were out of synch with our sales & marketing partners and facing a lot of internal conflict. But we came together as a team and worked hard to implement a well coordinated system of values, team structure, cadences, and standard practices. We're now in a much better place as a team and generating much better results for our company. There are no one-size-fits-all answers for companies. I can't promise that if you copy LeanKit you'll succeed. But we do think we have some interesting lessons learned to share and that you just might be able to pick up some ideas that you can take back to your company.
