**Abstract:**
Rewind to early 2013. Node.js v0.10 had just been released - this is the golden days of Node.js... and the beginning of the end. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">BDFL-model</a> and project stewardship have severely limited contribution (especially from larger corporations), and the lack of communication and transparency around decision making is making life as contributor to Node.js core intolerable. Stagnation of technical progress was unavoidable. Was Node.js doomed to fail before it could take off?

You probably know by now that Node.js did not fail, adoption and usage of Node.js has continued to grow each year. But how did this happen when the project was heading to a certain doom? In this talk I will use the backstory of how Node.js is built around the notion of openness and collaboration - known as <a href="http://openopensource.org/">Open Open Source</a> - to mobilise the community (more than 450 members in the GitHub organisation) and activate more contributors! I also talk about how the Node.js Foundation is structured and how all the bits and pieces works on building Node.js - one way or another.

The Open Open Source mantra:

<blockquote>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.</blockquote>

**Speaker:**
Hans Kristian Flaatten is an Open Source and Open Data evangelist. He is an acting member of the Node.js Foundation where he manage the test and release infrastructure for official Node.js versions, as well as the official Docker Image for Node.js.

He is a Senior Systems Developer / DevOps at the Norwegian Trekking Association (Norway's biggest outdoor activities organisation) where he have lead the transition to a microservice oriented architecture on immutable infrastructure and Docker Containers. He have also spear headed DNT's initiative on Open Data through <a href="http://ut.no/">UT.no</a> and Nasjonal Turbase.
