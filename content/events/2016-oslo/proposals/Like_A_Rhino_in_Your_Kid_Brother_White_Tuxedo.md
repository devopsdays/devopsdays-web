**Abstract:**
At night you dream of Microservices, Immutable Infrastructures and Immortal Awesomeness. By day you are looking after Oracle 9 systems on AIX with 32 bit Oracle Forms, due to be retired sometime in the decade after next.

This workshop will show you how you can use the fun new techniques that everyone is talking about to boot your legacy enterprise environment to be supplying SelfService for developers and running Continuous Deployment.

We'll supply you with your own cloud environment and all the scripts necessary to get a Self Service and CD environment running. To let you see CD in action and to kick the tyres yourself, we'll have an example set of enterprise applications with source code on  Windows/ASP.NET, PHP/MySQL and Java/OracleDB. Tools used, in no particular order, are: Terraform, Vagrant, Vault, Jenkins, Chef, Selenium, SonarQube, Nexus, VisualStudio.

All you need to bring is a pen, some paper, your laptop and a burning desire to squeeze your enterprise rhino into that small white tuxedo.

**Speaker:**
Jim Leitch - Computer Guy, originally from Scotland, most of his professional career has been spent in The Netherlands - he knows where the best stroopwafels are to be found.

**Format:**
