+++

**Abstract:**
You proudly created a modern microservices app, packaged it with Docker, used Consul as service registry and deployed it on Mesos/Marathon and it was fast and super easy! Now you want to put a reverse proxy in front of it... And you have to write ugly hacks :(

Why don't we create a modern reverse proxy in GO that would support several backends (Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Kubernetes, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB, Rest API, fileâ€¦) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically?
