**Abstract:**
This talk will guide you through practical aspects of the non-functional verification phase of the secure development life cycle process used in EVRY from information security perspective. Key features of security testing methodology based on OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) used within the company, particularly in Financial Services, as well as their correlation with PCI DSS are considered in the presentation. A transition from the theoretical methodologies and processes to real world scenarios will be shown on the real examples.

He is a member of the non-functional test department in Financial Services at EVRY; a penetration tester holding CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) and CES (Certified Encryption Specialist) certificates; a co-author of the Ukrainian standards of block cipher and hash function (DSTU 7624:2014 and DSTU 7564:2014).
