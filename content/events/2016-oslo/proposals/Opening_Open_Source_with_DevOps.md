**Abstract:**
DevOps has made great strides across the software world, but not yet in open-source. In this talk we'll look at real-world examples of how DevOps tools have been used to simplify setup, development and deployment in a selection of open-source projects, and learn how you too can use DevOps to make open-source more open, for everybody.

**Speaker:**
Tim Perry is a tech lead and the open-source champion at Softwire, a bespoke software development company in London, Bristol and Bucharest. He's also the creator of Build Focus, a contributor to a huge range of open-source tools across the JS, Java and C# ecosystems, and the maintainer of Loglevel and Server Components.
