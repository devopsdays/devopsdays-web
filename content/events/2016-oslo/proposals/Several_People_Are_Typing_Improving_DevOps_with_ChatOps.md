title = "Several People Are Typing... Improving DevOps with ChatOps"
+++

**Abstract:**
ChatOps is a collaboration model that connects teams, tools, process, and automation into one transparent workflow by presenting the work needed, the work happening, and the work to be done in one persistent location. This enhanced transparency tightens the feedback loop, improves information sharing, and enhances team cooperation. Not to mention team culture and cross-disciplinarity.

Conversation-driven collaboration isn’t new, but ChatOps is its digital-age manifestation: a combination of the oldest form of collaboration with the newest technology. Much of the success of ChatOps can be attributed towards it's attitude of integrating all the services coupled with highly customisable chat-bots. 

In this talk I will talk about how organisations can utilise conversation-driven development and operations – ChatOps – to empower their teams.
