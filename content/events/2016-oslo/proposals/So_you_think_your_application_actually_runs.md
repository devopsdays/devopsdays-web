**Abstract:**
<p>Have you ever considered how much can go wrong with your application even if the process actually runs? Even if your services seem to respond? Perhaps a bit of monitoring is a good idea!</p>

<p>Monitoring isn't a pre-defined solution you simply add to your application, though. It requires consideration of the system and environment, and may benefit from some clever planning. External monitoring is also a good alternative to traditional on-site installations.</p>

<p>We will look into benefits and disadvantages, as well as providing a few ideas for improving "monitorability" of an application. Experience with the commercial product of Site24x7.com will be used in this presentation.</p>

**Speaker:**
Carl Fredrik Hersoug is a developer that has maintained several systems for various customers over the years. Rather than focusing on one specialty, he likes to engage in what is necessary right here right now. Carl Fredrik usually develops a "personal" relationship with the systems he maintains, and likes to observe that these function as intended.

<p>Carl Fredrik has lived in, and worked from, Trondheim, Oslo and Mexico. Speaks spanish fairly well, but fails completely in the dialect of "tr√∏ndersk".</p>
