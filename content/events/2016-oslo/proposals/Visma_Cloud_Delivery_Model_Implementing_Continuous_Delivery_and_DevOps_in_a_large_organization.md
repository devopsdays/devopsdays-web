+++

**Abstract:**
Like many others, Visma is in the process of moving from a world in which SaaS development teams are separated from operations and deploying to Production 3-12 times a year - to a world in which the development teams themselves have full responsibility for their service, including operational responsibility, and are expected to deliver much more frequently. How have we approached this, what has been our challenges, how have we tried to solve them, and where are we now?
