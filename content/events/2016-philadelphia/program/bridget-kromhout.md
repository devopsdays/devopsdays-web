  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Cloudy With a Chance of Devops
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Devops is culture enabled by tools, which are necessary but not sufficient. I touch on the history of devopsdays and the motivations that lead orgs to devops, while encouraging orgs to collaborate, communicate, and iterate towards increasing value for their orgs.
