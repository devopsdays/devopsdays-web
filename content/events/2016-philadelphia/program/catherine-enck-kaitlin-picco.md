DIY Tech Inclusion
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Well-funded tech companies are hiring consultants or high-level leaders to help them create inclusive work cultures.  But if you don't have the budget for a consultant or a Chief Diversity Officer, we can walk you through some tried and true DIY steps to creating a more inclusive work environment.  We will focus on the four pillars of workplace inclusion: hiring, retention, promotion, and culture.  Whether you're a 4-person start-up or a 200-person international tech company, a CEO or an entry-level developer, our DIY guide will provide you with the tools to create a more inclusive environment that will benefit employees and an organization's bottom line.
