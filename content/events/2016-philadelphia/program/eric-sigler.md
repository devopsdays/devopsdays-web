  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Do You Know If Your Service Is Working Properly? A Guide To Being Paranoid.
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
End-to-end monitoring, testing, and validation of an application or service can be helpful to both development and the business if done properly.  It lets you answer the age old question "Is $APP up?" with confidence.  Especially when individual service-owning teams are part of a larger whole, having a way to rapidly iterate and verify your changes is vital.

This talk will go over background & history on end-to-end testing efforts, then discuss best practices for care and feeding of such systems, and pitfalls to avoid, with references.
