  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Nooo! Ops: Ops for Serverless Apps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
The term "NoOps" has been bandied as the next evolution in DevOps. Most recently, this has resurfaced with interest in "serverless" application development. By consuming hosted infrastructure offerings such as AWS Lambda and Firebase, it has been argued that operations will no longer be needed.

I'll go over the real operational challenges that early adopters of AWS Lambda (& similar services) are facing, review solutions to these problems, and dispel the "NoOps" Myth.
