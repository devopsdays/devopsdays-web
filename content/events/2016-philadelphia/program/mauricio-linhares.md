  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
From Dev to DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Leaving the comfort zone of throwing code over the wall so the OPS team can deploy takes either guts or insanity. Developers should care more about how their products reach customers and one of the best ways to do this is to get into DevOps and involve themselves in the process of making sure the code is doing it's best being a good citizen in the actual environment. We'll see some of the hops, prejudices and issues developers have to face when they start their journey into the DevOps land and how this will improve their skill set and the final  experience customers have actually using the product.
