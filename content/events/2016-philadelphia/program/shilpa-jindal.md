  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
How CI/CD helped us "Bill Pay team" to deliver features faster to customers
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Earlier bill pay services were scattered in different regions, delivered in different release cycles by different teams. Consolidating all those services to a Microservice, integrated with CI/CD to deploy on AWS made it convenient and faster for team to deliver bug fixes or new services faster to client.
