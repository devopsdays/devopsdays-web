**Title:** Metrics, Gauges, Counters and Ratios; designing and implementing quality metrics

**Description:**

The only thing worse than no metrics are bad and/or misleading ones. Well-designed metrics enable you to quickly know the state of your service and have confidence that your systems are healthy. Poor metrics distract you from finding root causes of outages and extend downtime. Unfortunately it isn't always obvious what counts and how to count it.

This talk will cover the essential attributes needed in quality metrics and walk participants through the steps needed to capture them in a useful format while avoiding common pitfalls in metric design. The principles of metric design, types of metrics, and when to use the common types will be covered. Come learn about ratios, gauges, counters; primary, secondary, proxy and derived metrics; as well as intervals, ordinals and more.
