**Title:** DevOps vs. SRE: Fight! (wait, I mean Learn!)

**Description:**

Just within the last ten years (+-3), we have seen at least two separate communities evolve from the generic idea of Systems Administration/Operations. The first, DevOps, grew up very much in public, the second happened more within the halls of “special” companies like Google and Facebook and is only now starting to gain visibility and traction in the wider world. They have a number of priorities in common but also diverge in some very interesting ways. In this talk we’ll explore the key things we can learn from each group and see what might happen if we cross the streams.
