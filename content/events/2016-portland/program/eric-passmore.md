**Title:** Stop doing Failure Mode Analysis and Start doing Checklists

**Description:**

Cultural changes are hard, and educating large teams in DevOps takes time. Half the time we feel like we are in the Rebel Alliance trying to overthrow the empire. There is a better way. Ignore the cultural changes, stop doing failure mode analysis and start doing checklists. Checklist work because people learn by doing. Teams do not push back because everyone is doing the work. 

Learn why failure mode analysis does not work, how to build a checklist, and how to roll out a checklist.
