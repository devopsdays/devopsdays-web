**Title:** Being an introvert and at a conference, not as hellish as you think it is.

**Description:**

I'd like to give some advice on how to deal with conferences as an introvert.

Over the last couple years I've grown and learned to engage with the tech community in ways that an introvert would find challenging. This talk will hopefully help the audience avoid some of the landmines that I have stepped on.

I want to help out my fellow introverts to realize that it's OK to be an introvert at big conferences. We can enjoy them too.
