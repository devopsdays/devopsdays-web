**Title:** Defending against CDD: Chaos-Driven Delivery

**Description:**

Have you heard of TDD? Well, many teams struggle with CDD: Chaos-Driven Delivery. That is, teams struggle with how to handle the constant onslaught of overwhelming amounts of work and begin to lose hope. The good news is that if you understand operating systems, you already know a great deal about how to tame the chaos! 

Process management is an integral part of an operating system. The OS makes decisions about scheduling, sharing information between jobs, handling interrupts and multi-tasking. It also has to manage the resources of a process and be concerned with process synchronization, just as we mere humans do. This presentation will show you how to apply common concepts from operating system process management to the way teams process work. Attend and help your team kick CDD to the curb!
