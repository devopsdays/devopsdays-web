**Title:** DevOps: A History

**Description:**

In the midst of buzzwords like "devops", "containers", "continuous delivery", "IAAS", and even "cloud" it can be easy to forget the problems these concept were created to solve. It is impossible to fully understand DevOps as it is now without understanding where it came from. This talk will take you through a journey of each stage of the DevOps movement - from the very beginning to the most bleeding edge tools and concepts of today. At each stage I will thoroughly cover the "how" and "why" - including personal testimonials from those involved - Devops evolved the way it did. Go beyond the buzzwords and gain a new understanding of the how and why of Devops. You will walk away with a new understanding of why we used to do things - what problems we were trying to solve, what brought DevOps to where it is now, and itâ€™s potential for the future.
