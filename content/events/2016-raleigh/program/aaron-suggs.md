  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Context & Contingency: Patterns for choosing good tools
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>At Kickstarter, the Ops Engineering team recently deployed Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana to centralize application logs. I’ll use our implementation of the ELK stack as a case-study to examine our process for choosing tools, particularly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>when to build vs. buy</li>
<li>what features we need in the initial version, and what can wait until later</li>
<li>when to invest effort in an elegant solution, or when to get by with a hack.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>This talk will discuss what factors influenced our decisions (context); and what future changes could lead to a different choice (contingency).
</p>
<p>By capturing the context and contingency of our choices, we can more easily adapt to changes in our organization and the tech community.
</p>
<p>I’ll show how our implementation decisions impacted the processes and behaviors of our team; which in turn influenced and reflected our organization’s culture.

  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Code Is Communication
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>This is an invocation to give everyone in your organization access to your code and version control.
</p>
<p>Version control brings radical transparency and context to our work. Let’s not keep it to ourselves! At Kickstarter, we’ve invited our entire staff to GitHub: customer support, HR, legal staff, everyone!
</p>
<p>These teams contribute to the product and make pull requests. Our engineering team has benefited from having more inclusive conversations.
</p>
<p>And the whole organization has benefited from embracing a culture of transparency and inclusion.
</p>
<p>You should do it too!</p>
