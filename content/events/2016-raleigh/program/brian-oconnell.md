<p>Professional Golf and Tennis tournaments plan all year to deliver a global sporting experience for several days or weeks.  The computing infrastructure must be continuously available for millions of visitors that produce hundreds of thousands of concurrent sessions.  IBMâ€™s team that serves digital sporting experiences has transformed and adopted DevOps principals to build a multi-region hybrid public and private cloud.   This hybrid cloud Infrastructure delivers Wimbledon, The French Open, Australian Open, The US Open, and The Masters. </p>
