  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Your goat antifragiled my snowflake!: Demystifying DevOps Jargon</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Are you a cow, a goat, a canary, or a unicorn?  Are running K8S? Who the heck is Brent?  Find out!
</p><p>

</p><p>
In this fun session, we'll go over some of the more unintuitive terms (being a goat is a good thing!) and the backstories behind them.
