  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Data Before DevOps</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Do you need DevOps? Of course you do but how do you sell it to your team, managers and higher? With data! By telling a story with data we can analyze where the workflow is failing currently and if we can improve it and by how much! Focus on meaningful metrics and conversations rather than anecdotes
