  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Oncall for Developers
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>With emergence of DevOps approach to application development, deployment and management developers get more and more involved in day-to-day system operations. Lately, there has been a popular point of view that developers should be included in oncall rotation on equal grounds with sys admins. While I don't fully subscribe to that mentality, there are certain processes that must be implemented by every organization to get developers involved in production operation of the software they built.  In this talk I'll walk through different aspects of operational oncall responsibilities and discuss ways in which developers should (and should not) be involved in operation of production systems.</p>
