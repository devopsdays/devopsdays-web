  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Oh no! MGMT wants to do DevOps now
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>During this Ignite talk we will demystify some common misconceptions about DevOps.  We will help answer such questions as "What about change control?", "What stops a developer from releasing unacceptable code?", and hush the phrases "but that's that's my job" or "that's not my job".
