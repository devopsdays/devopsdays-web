**Abstract:**

Some of us may be surprised to hear that DevOps and Continuous Delivery are not necessarily an IT auditor's nightmare. In fact, reducing organizational risk a the primary goal that is shared between GRC and delivery teams using DevOps and Continuous Delivery. In this session, Joanne will walk you through the things you should be doing and thinking about as a delivery team to demonstrate to GRC and audit teams that this is a better way to work to reduce overall organizational risk.

**Speaker:** Joanne Molesky
