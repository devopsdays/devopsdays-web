**Abstract:**

Enterprises can sprawl across many different verticals, with unique challenges such as compliance, seasonal demand and sudden market shifts. Under these challenges however are some commonalities that enable the creation of a broader community which can unify them.

I will share my experiences with helping to build DevOps cultures and principles in ten business units and how building a broader community helped to bring them together. Looking at culture, process and tools I will share the approaches that enabled higher levels of engagement and support for all involved.

**Speaker:** Pauly Comtois
