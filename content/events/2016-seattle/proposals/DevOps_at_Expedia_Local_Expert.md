**Abstract:**

Expedia Local Expert started with no API over 3 years ago and a very small web footprint, however in the last few years weâ€™ve created a development and operations organization which runs on the fuel of the DevOps fundamentals. This has allowed our business to grow at a phenomenally rate and redefine IT in the Expedia culture and share that with the community

**Speaker:** Chad Buffett
