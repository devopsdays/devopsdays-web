type = "talk"

+++

**Abstract:**


So what happens when you're brought in to a team and asked to "introduce a metrics culture" or "measure all the things?" This talk will cover just that: how to assess the state of affairs in your team or organization regarding measurement, how to decide what things to measure for maximum impact, and how to best communicate and iterate those measurements throughout the journey. The talk will cover these topics using my own journey at Chef as well as journeys I see at other companies that I meet and consult with.

**Speaker:** Nicole Forsgren
