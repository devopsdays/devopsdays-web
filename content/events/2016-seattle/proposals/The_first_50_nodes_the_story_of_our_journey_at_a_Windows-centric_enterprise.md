**Abstract:**

In this talk we’ll discuss our own journey at Columbia Sportswear including:
* Overcoming the “yeah windows can already do everything you want us to do”
* Overcoming the “we don’t run Linux and this can’t work here"
* Getting Engineers to buy in that they current skillset will not sustain them
* Finding a couple of early adopters
* Finding allies (peers) in the organization
* Using a series of experiments to incrementally converge on version control, exposing work, kanbans, demos, etc.
* Optimizing the automation to be as inviting as possible (yes we did some hard coding at times)
* Starting the organization on the path to becoming a learning organization
* Tempering enthusiasm to keep the entire team moving forward

**Speaker:** Scott Nasello
