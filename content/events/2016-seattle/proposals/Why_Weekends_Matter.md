**Abstract:**

Excluding weekends from your metrics reports may sound appealing when the goal is to reduce lead-time and/or cycle-time in your workflow. From a reporting perspective, it’s nice to show improvement, so why not exclude times when people aren’t thought to be working? This strongly opinionated ignite talk exposes three serious reasons why excluding weekends from time metrics reporting can get you into deep kimchi.

Disclosure: I am an organizer for Devopsdays Seattle and therefore ineligible to participate in the discussion or voting of this proposed ignite talk.

**Speaker:** Dominica DeGrandis
