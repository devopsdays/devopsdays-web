<p>
DevOpsDays is a not-for-profit event run entirely by unpaid volunteers. The pricing for a ticket is designed to be as low as possible, and is actually less than the cost of food alone for each participant. Keeping this in mind, if you wish to attend but the cost is prohibitive, please <a href="mailto:organizers-seattle-2016@devopsdays.org">email</a> us and we'll try to work something out.
