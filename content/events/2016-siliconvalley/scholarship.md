<h2> DevOpsDays Silicon Valley 2016 Diversity Scholarship </h2>

<p>
DevOpsDays Silicon Valley believes that diversity is critical to a healthy community and its growth. So one of our goals is to address the lack of diversity in attendees at our conference.
</p>
<p>
We realize that one barrier to attending conferences is that people may not have the privilege of working at a job that affords conference attendance. To that end, we are announcing scholarship tickets to DevOpsDays Silicon Valley. We do have some funds for additional assistance (such as airfare, lodging, childcare or gas) so please let us know if you have those needs in the form below!
</p>

<p>We will also have a Conference Liaison who can assist on site. </p>
