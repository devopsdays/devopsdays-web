  <h2>Workshop - Creating a Continuous Delivery Pipeline: A Hands-On Workshop</h2>
  <p>
  Although continuous delivery (CD) and DevOps are growing in popularity, not much practical information is available about how to get started. This hands-on technical tutorial is the place to get your feet wet and your questions answered.
  </p>
  <p>
  Bring a laptop with the appropriate software installed (see note below), and Ken Mugrage will provide everything else you need for this workshop. You will configure a complete continuous delivery pipeline from source code commit through deployment. Learn when to run each common type of automated test for the fastest possible feedback and how to run tests in parallel for shorter cycle times. Moving from practice to theory, Ken explores industry studies and peer-reviewed scientific research that show the value of practicing continuous delivery and adopting a DevOps culture. He describes how the need for CD developed and then fed the requirements for culture change to support DevOps and CD practices.
  </p>
  <p>
  In this workshop, learn how to create and then practice creating a continuous delivery pipeline—from the ground up.
