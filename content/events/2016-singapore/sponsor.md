We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring, please <a href="mailto:organizers-singapore-2016@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor DevOpsDays Singapore 2016">drop us an email</a> or [download the prospectus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-L7Gu-eJct3em15bzFreGZWMU5jVnZ6S2pyckl2TGpZY053) right away.

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute the attendee contact lists.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

## Sponsor FAQ

<img src="/events/2015-singapore/location/venue_table_size.jpg" alt="Picture of the sponsor booth table" style="width: 100%;"/>

### When can we pick our booth spot?

Booths are not selectable. Our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks before the conference date.

You can enter the venue Saturday morning at 7:30 am to set up your table.

### How many scanners (and which type) do we get?

None. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks and this conference is not a typical conference or convention.

We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the sessions. You are responsible to collect any information you want in person if you want to do giveaways.

### Can we bring a 1m roll-up as our back wall?

Whatever you bring must fit behind or on your table (185 x 80 cm).

### Will we have any chairs at our booth?

Each booth comes with 2 chairs.

### Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need the graphics?

You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on or behind the table.

### Do we get any sponsored talks?

No, but you are welcome to submit a proposal for consideration through <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2016-singapore/propose/">our CfP form</a>.

### Do we get electricity connection for out booth?

Yes, you will get a power strip (Plug <a href="http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm">Type G</a>).

### Will wifi connection be good enough for showing demos?

We do not provide Wifi. Wifi has to be booked as extra on the venue.

### Do we get an advertising in the program? When do you need the graphics?

We will be using the logos that are sent by you.

### Do we get a dedicated email blast?

No, even better: we will give you a Twitter <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091205132038AA2uqcy">shout out</a>.

### Who should I send?

Not marketing folks. Send your techie geeks that can interact with attendees during the sessions and the breaks.

### How do I pay the sponsorship package?

Invoices will be handled by our conference partner. You will receive an invoice including GST, if applicable.

For this, we need the official business address, full name of your contact and GST number.

### How do we register our sponsor tickets?

Once payment is complete, we will send you an email requesting registration details of the attendees that will use the tickets associated with your sponsorship level.

### How many people do you expect?

We are planning for 150 attendees.

### What kind of attendees will come to the conference?

We are focusing on people who are architecting and building distributed applications or doing migration projects, especially those away from monolithic software. This will typically include Architects, Lead Developers, and IT-Operations.

### Do you have media partners who will cover the conference?

No; however, if you have an idea to support the event in the media, please <a href="mailto:organizers-singapore-2016@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor DevOpsDays Singapore 2016">let us know</a>!

### Can we ship stuff ahead?
