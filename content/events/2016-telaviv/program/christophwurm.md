  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Using Elastic to monitor everything
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>"Evolution of Elasticsearch - from unstructured to structured data<br>
  1. Search<br>
  2. Logging<br>
  3. Metrics<br>
<br>
Technical deep dive on 1 - 2 features that allowed this evolution, probably:<br>
  - Columnar storage (doc values)<br>
  - Number storage (BKD trees)<br>
<br>
Beats - open source framework for building agents/shippers/forwarders to collect and forward data<br>
  1. Logs (Filebeat, Winlogbeat)<br>
  2. Passive packet capture (Packetbeat)<br>
  2. Metrics (existing modules for Top, Apache/Nginx, Mysql/Postgresql, Redis, Cassandra, Docker, and many more)<br>
<br>
Live demo of Packetbeat: running on my laptop, capturing live HTTP requests to websites I visit, all data including URLs, HTTP headers, etc. are immediately in Elasticsearch and are visualised with Kibana."</p>
