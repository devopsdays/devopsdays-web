  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  The Stories We Tell and the Failures We've Lived
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>Most conference talks center around success stories. In this lighthearted yet sincere talk, Corey discusses some of his more embarrassing professional failures.</p>
  <p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>

  <p>"Corey has a long and storied history as a consultant -- long, in that every year he did it felt like three years, and storied, in that he's got a few. Prior to his current role as Director of DevOps at FutureAdvisor, he spent most of the past few years at a Bay Area consulting firm, where he served as a systems architect, ad-hoc recruiter, advocate for driving transformational change throughout organizations, and (due to a misunderstanding around what a ""standup meeting"" really was) an improvisational comic. One of the early developers behind Saltstack, Corey also has a rich history of contributing to various open source projects.

Corey's hobbies include motorcycles, building custom keyboards, and drinking whiskey-- it's a shame that they all don't work well together. He lives in San Francisco with his wife and two rodents of unusual size masquerading as dogs."</p>
