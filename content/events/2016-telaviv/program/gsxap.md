  </p>

  <p><strong>Nati Shalom - Why</strong></p>

  <p>
  We often hear lots of success stories on new startups that were able to break their way to hyper growth through disruption. What we don't hear often is what happens to startups that get disrupted themselves. In this session i will share my own personal experience as the CTO and founder of GigaSpaces on how we distributed the traditional database market with distributed in-memory database and how we got disrupted ourselves later by other open-source NoSQL startups. What we have done to disrupt ourselves by launching new open-source products in cloud orchestration and big data world and how those moves transformed our business and company DNA. Many of the lessons from this experience can serve other entrepreneurs that are facing disruption and need to deal with impatient customers, investors and market.
  This is a the story on a 16 years old startup who had to re-invent itself.

  <p><strong>Barak Bar Orion - How</strong></p>
  If you start a new software project tomorrow morning, itll almost certainly be open source. However, 10-15 years ago, before GitHub ruled the earth, that was not the case, and mature products find themselves in a disadvantage when compared to new open source rivals. So - How do you turn you project inside out and open source its core? What technical challenges arise, and how do you confront them? How do you decide what should be open sourced and what not? Once you've decided, how do you estimate it and refactor it? And lets not forget your existing customers, which expect a smooth transition... Is that even possible? Yes! - Join us as we share stories and tips from our journey of taking a 15-years old product to the Open Source era.
