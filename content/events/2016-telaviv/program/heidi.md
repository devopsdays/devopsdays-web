  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Heidi Waterhouse - Fear of the Bus
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>

  Devops is almost always responsible for documenting their own stuff, and frequently they are moving so quickly that this step gets shortcut or omitted. I want to give people in devops some simple, straightforward, repeatable, testable tools to make sure that all the mission-critical data is not dependent on one person or role.<br>
  We're going to have to do much more nimble, flexible documentation methods than remembering to enter things in Confluence. I'm going to use post-its, commit messages, slack emojis, and crowd suggestions to show you how to do good-enough documentation without slowing your organization down.<br><br>
