  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  There’s An App For That: Why Every Team Has Their Own Tools
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>Why do companies seem to collect monitoring solutions like pokemon cards?  Because it's easier for a group to buy their own tool than to try to work with another group and share an existing system, and at the end of the day they are only going to trust the system that they "own". The good news is that fear and trust issues are two things which DevOps culture is designed to combat and overcome!</p>
