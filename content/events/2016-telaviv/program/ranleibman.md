  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
   Production Engineering - There is no Spoon
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
  	A couple of years ago Facebook bought the Israeli company Onavo. During Onavo's migrating into FB we decided to migrate not only our servers and tooling, but also the methodology.
One of the things we noticed was the mentality - there is no real difference between a software engineer and production engineer in terms of owning code in production. Surprisingly this  works very well.<br><br>
My talk purpose is to:<br>
1. describe the process we went through from the time we realized that we need to change something and what was the trigger.<br>
2. what other solutions we could have chose to do<br>
3. why we chose the PE way<br>
4. how we applied it<br>
5. what we could have done better<br>
6. our takeaways notes<br>
7. QnA
