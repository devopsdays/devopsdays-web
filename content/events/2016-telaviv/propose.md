<hr>
There are two ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 45 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
</ol>

### Even if you don't propose, please consider {{< event_link page="proposals" text="commenting on proposals submitted by others" >}}

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.

<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> 

Fill out the form at http://goo.gl/forms/UBAWiffHptWZENGK2

<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.</li>
	<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
