### Are YOU the Change Agent your Organization is Looking For…?

**Abstract:**

For most organizations, DevOps means a change, both to your process and your way of thinking. Change is hard and being the one to introduce change into your organization is even more difficult. In this Ignite, I’ll talk about the assumptions we make about change, the universal truths we accept about change, the questions to ask yourself before initiating change and four approaches to bringing it. With the help of the book Change Anything: The New Science of Personal Success, I’ll show how you can be the transformer & revolutionary you’ve always dreamed of being.
