### Devops Evolution at Nulogy

**Abstract:**

At Nulogy, our operations are supported by our Infrastructure team, colloquially known as the "Computer Friends and Justin"
We are proud to have brought together a team of five veteran hackers with diverse academic and other backgrounds.

We've recently been through a banner year of growth - having aggressively tackled quick wins to greatly improve the reliability of our flagship SaaS Logistics product to the point where it can be sold to large multinational corporations with a real need for "four nines" of uptime.

Everyone on the team is a great fit with our well rounded company culture, but none of us started out in life as Devops Experts. We've learned it, and we want to help you learn it, too.

The company had already been in operation for over ten years by the time we began to embrace DevOps and related practices. How is it possible to beat down technical debt with so many legacy systems, high SLA requirements and entrenched customers practices.
And more to the point: how will this work make your work/life balance better?

Ian Penney has been working as a Systems Administrator and Systems Manager for over 15 years. He's worked at large companies like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other enterprises through an IBM business partner, as well as with over 200 startups, from coast to coast.

A few years ago, he realized Infrastructure as Code was the future, and so he began focusing on using tools like Chef, Puppet and Ansible.

Most recently he's celebrated his first happy anniversary at Nulogy as the lead of their Infrastructure Team during a rapid transition towards "moar devops" and less risk.
