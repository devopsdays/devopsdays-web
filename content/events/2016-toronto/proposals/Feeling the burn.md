### Feeling the burn?

**Abstract:**

Burnout is often thought to be limited to Silicon Valley, but it's a very real problem here in the GTA. In this five minute talk, we'll explore the signs and symptoms of burnout, talk about the guilt, second guessing, and other feelings associated with it and what you can do to help yourself, your co-workers, and your friends in the community.
