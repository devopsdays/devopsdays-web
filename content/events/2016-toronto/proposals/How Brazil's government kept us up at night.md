### How Brazil's government kept us up at night

**Abstract:**

On the evening of December 16th, 2015, Brazil's government decided to ban the use of the popular WhatsApp platform. Over 93% of Brazil's internet population, roughly 93 million, use WhatsApp as part of their daily lives. The ban forced an uprising and lash back on social media, and the more savvy users began finding ways of circumventing. This talk tells the story of how this ban affected our own team and kept us up all night!
