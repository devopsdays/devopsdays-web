### Waterboy - our robot coworker

**Abstract:**

Waterboy is our Hubot instance that provides helpful information for both operations and developers. Our organization is somewhat atypical -- we are an external infrastructure consulting practice embedded into a development organization. This talk will cover:

+ How we introduced a chatbot into the organization
+ How we manage the robot and encourage people to contribute
+ How we figure out what goes into the robot
+ How we use ChatOps to facilitate communication between ourselves, and between us and the client.

People attending this talk will get a different perspective on the use of chat in a collaborative environment. It's not just shortcuts to memes, nor is it "hubot please go deploy the site and make me coffee". Chat can be a CLI to your organization. One that empowers employees and helps spread knowledge.

I'm a problem solver. A software developer that loves applying software principles to infrastructure automation and web applications.

I wanted to program most of my life, realized I didn't like it during my first job, spent 13 years as a network guy that wrote a lot of code, joined an awesome web startup as a web developer, and have rediscovered my joy for software development. After that ended, I moved into a more devops type role where I can have my feet in both camps. I'm currently with a consulting company that's responsible for the infrastructure and applications at a large American sporting league.
