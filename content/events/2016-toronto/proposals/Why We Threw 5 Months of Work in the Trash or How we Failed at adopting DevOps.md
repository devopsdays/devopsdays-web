### Why We Threw 5 Months of Work in the Trash; or How we Failed at adopting DevOps

**Abstract:**

Last summer we started an engineering enablement engagement in Seattle. Very quickly we decided DevOps enablement had a lot of potential and started our work...5 months later the "DevOps" part of work was shot down by management due to lack of result. We will take a look at three main reasons that we failed. These are pitfalls that can happen in any company and any project.

I'm a developer at ThoughtWorks. I tend to focus on work in the cloud and continuous delivery space, more recently focusing on the use of microservice architectures. I love learning new things and helping people build better systems. I love presenting ideas, meeting people and learning new things, and I find conferences a great way to help that. I've also written a few articles along the way.
