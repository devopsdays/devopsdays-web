### dotfiles.CI

**Abstract:**

Do you have Continuous Integration, or DevOps on your resume or LinkedIn? Do you have years of maintaining a solid deployment pipeline and nothing to show prospective employers on your Github profile. For many companies seeing is believing. In this talk I'll show you how I built tests and a CI pipeline around my dotfiles for prospective clients.
