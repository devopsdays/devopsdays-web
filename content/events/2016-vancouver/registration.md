### If money is a problem

Devopsdays is a volunteer-organized event - literally by and for the Vancouver devops community. We want to make sure that our event welcomes everyone in our community. Thatâ€™s why we take our [code of conduct](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-vancouver/conduct/) seriously, for example. It is also why we offer grants to people for whom money is a barrier.

If the ticket price of the conference is outside of your means, [write to us and explain your situation.](mailto:organizers-vancouver-2016@devopsdays.org) We might very well be able to help.
