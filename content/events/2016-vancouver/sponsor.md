## Sponsor FAQ

### Can you send me a floor plan?
Yes, we will be sending this out when we have one. The general floor plan can be found [here](http://robsonsquare.ubc.ca/facility-rentals/rooms/floor-plans/), we will sending an event specfic one out once we have it finalized.

### How big is our booth space?
For Gold Sponsors, you will receive a table and two chairs.  Silver sponsors share a swag table where they can lay out printed materials, stickers or other swag. For silver sponsors, keep in mind this is a shared table so please be a good neighbour and plan accordingly. In any event - we encourage sponsors to send engineers to interact with attendees during session breaks, and to avoid large displays and heavy marketing materials.

### Can we choose our booth location?
Booths are not selectable. Our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks from conference date.

### Do we get an electricital connection for our booth?
Yes. A power strip (more importantly, one attached to actual power) will be provided.

### Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need graphics?
You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on the table or behind it. If you have a dedicated table feel free to bring a 1m roll up or other backdrop materials that fit, but for the most part - this conference is not about the booth!

### Will the wifi connection be good enough for showing demos?
Yes, depending on what’s being demonstrated! If you have particular needs, please let us know that you will be accommodating your own network requirements.

### Will there be scanners (and which type), and what about giveaways?
No scanners. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks and this conference is not a typical conference or convention. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the sessions--not just at the booth. You are responsible to collect any info you want in person if you want to do giveaways. On the final day at closing session, we will give a time slot for a giveaway.

### What does the one minute pitch (for applicable sponsors) entail?
Between sessions, Gold Sponsors are given one minute to introduce themselves and their company to the full audience. The emcee will invite a small number to make an introduction during transitions between sessions on either day 1 or day two, depending on the final schedule. In addition to the full audience, your one-minute pitch will be broadcast to the audience watching the live Internet video feed, which will also be posted up to the site afterwards. No slides will be displayed, there is not sufficient time in sixty seconds.

### What does the five minute demo during open space sessions entail?
[General information about open space format](/pages/open-space-format/)

We will have a space set aside for sequential demos from sponsors. During the "Open space Opening", participants put forth and vote on ideas for discussion topics. If you have prepared a five minute demo, your demonstrator can add a topic "Demo by <CompanyName> " to the board. We will announce the location of the demo space when we get ready to disperse participants to the open space sessions, and participants can choose to attend the demos as they see fit.

### Do we get any sponsored talks?
No, but you are welcome to submit a proposal like everyone else.

### Do we get an ad in the program? When do you need graphics?
Send us a URL to your logo. When you do, we’ll download the image, size it appropriately, and include it on our web site.

### Do we get a dedicated email blast?
No. As a Sponsor, you will be included in the Thank You email at the end of the conference, along with a URL to your landing page. You are responsible to collect any info you want in person if you wish to contact participants.

### Who should I send to DevOpsDays?
Send your technical folks that can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks. All experience levels are welcome.

### What are the demographics of the attendees?
Technologists, architects, technology managers.
