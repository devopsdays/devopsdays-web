DevOpsDays DC 2016 will be held at [The United States Patent and Trademark
Office](http://www.uspto.gov/)'s Madison Auditorium at 600 Dulany Street,
Alexandria, Virginia, just outside the District (but inside the Beltway!) Please
see [USPTO's directions
page](http://www.uspto.gov/about/contacts/locations/directions.jsp) for driving
directions and parking information.


We recommend the [Westin](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/events/start.action?id=1604145506&key=15F5399A), just a few
blocks from the USPTO. Reserve your room in the <strong>DevOpsDays Room Block</strong> for 
$249 per night by May 15.

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst in the
nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you are visiting
from out of town. Instead, take [Metro](http://www.wmata.com/) to the event.
USPTO is located a few blocks from the [King Street/Old
Town](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=48) station, which
is served by Blue and Yellow line trains. It's also a short ride from [National
Airport (DCA)](http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport), our
recommended airport for visitors from out of town. If you're arriving at Dulles
(IAD), Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station, Metro's [trip
planner](http://wmata.com/rider_tools/tripplanner/tripplanner_form_solo.cfm) can
help you get to the event.
