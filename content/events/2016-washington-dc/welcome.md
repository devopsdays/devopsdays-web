## About Washington, DC

If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or _House of Cards_,
you're missing out. While its importance as the Nation's Capital and center of
government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District, Maryland, and Virginia) is also
home to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and
culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community. If
you're coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every
segment of our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some time to check out
everything else the Nation's Capital has to offer, from the many free
Smithsonian museums to great food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere
to our three local airports, and there are several hotels nearby. More details
are on the {{< event_link page="location" text="location page" >}}.
