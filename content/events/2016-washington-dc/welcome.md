## About Washington, DC

If all you know of Washington, DC is what you see on C-SPAN or _House of Cards_, you're missing out. While its importance as the Nation's Capital and center of government is undisputed, the "DMV" (District, Maryland, and Virginia) is also home to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

If you're local, you already know the diversity of our DevOps community. If you're coming in from elsewhere, prepare to mix with DevOps leaders from every segment of our vibrant local scene. And, of course, take some time to check out everything else the Nation's Capital has to offer, from the many free Smithsonian museums to great food and drink!

For those coming from out of town, there are flights from just about everywhere to our three local airports, and there are several hotels nearby. More details are on the {{< event_link page="location" text="location page" >}}.
