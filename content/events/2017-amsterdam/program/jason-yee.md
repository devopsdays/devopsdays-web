Henry Ford once said, “The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.” So how can we learn the most from system failures? This session will move beyond “blameless” postmortems to show how we can use data to avoid & mitigate future failures.

I'll cover best practices for gather systems-related data, people-related data & how to use the data to formulate actionable response plans & avoid repeating failures."
