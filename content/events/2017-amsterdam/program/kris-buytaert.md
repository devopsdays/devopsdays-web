<p><strong>Title:</strong> 7 years of #devopsdays, 5 years in Amsterdam</p>

<p>
A retrospective on 7.5 years of #devopsdays , when talking to Patrick at CloudCamp Antwerp and deciding to run the very first edition of #devopsdays in Gent back in 2009 , we were not planning on keeping this event running for 3/4 of a decade, travelling all over the world let alone talking to 1000+ person crowds with bodyguard protecting us from selfie crazyness. But it did happen.. #devopsdays has evolved. This talk will document that journey, and look at the future..
