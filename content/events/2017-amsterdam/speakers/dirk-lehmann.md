I'm doing the technical operations of SAPs cloud based ride sharing solution 'TwoGo by SAP'. TwoGo became the first product in SAP history which delivers changes on a daily basis to our customers (since Oct. 2014). We archived this as a pilot in our company applying Continuous Delivery and DevOps techniques and now act as a role model and knowledge multiplicator within SAP. I give external talks and presentations (e.g. DevOpsDays Paris 2015, Entwicklertag Karlsruhe, Beyond Borders MeetUp -DevOps Amsterdam, Continuous Lifecycle 2015, Delivery of Things World 2016) on Continuous Delivery and DevOps (with focus on large enterprises), as well as SAP internal workshops on these subjects.
