Edward van Deursen bought his first computer in the 80’s, a Commodore64. That’s where his passion for computers begun. In the late 80’s he started his career as a Cobol programmer on mainframes and mini systems. Later he developed software in C/C++ for PC’s. In 2006 he swapped to QA with roles like tester, test manager and QA manager. In these roles he discovered that most product owners are focused on functionality and not on performance and security. Edward started a security test team within the organisations he was working for. Edward is currently fulfilling the roles of CISO and DPO at Raad van State (Council of State in the Netherlands). He is coaching Scrum teams to get more and better security and privacy requirements and awareness in place. Edward van Deursen is a Certified Ethical Hacker and a Certified Information Privacy Manager.
