Jonathan, Mary and Wouter started working at bol.com as Young Professionals. They started as newbies in different parts of the company but ended up being struggling developers with the same aspiration: to not just run things on production but also understand it like Operations. Jonathan wants to know how everything works together and aspires to be the full stack guru that people can always turn to. Mary studied Informatics and fell in love with programming languages; however, prefers to work in the industry. Main passion is coding but on the side she likes to make an impact. Wouter is a common dutch name but there is nothing common about him, he tried different studies till he chose software development. He likes software development because he likes how IT affects the real world.
