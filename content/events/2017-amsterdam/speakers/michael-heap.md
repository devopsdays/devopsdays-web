Michael is a polyglot software engineer, committed to reducing complexity in systems and making them more predictable. Working with a variety of languages and tools, he shares his technical expertise to audiences all around the world at user groups and conferences.

Day to day, Michael is a fixer. He works on whatever needs an extra pair of hands both at his day job and in open source projects. When not immersed in technology, you'll find him either playing various board games or hiking through the countryside.
