The workshop will begin with setting up a Kubernetes cluster and understanding the components of the architecture. We’ll go through interacting with Kubernetes via kubectl, then we’ll cover Pods, Replica Sets, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets, Volumes and understand what the differences between them are before deploying each of these to our clusters. Next, we’ll deploy a basic application using some of these resource types, perform a blue/green deployment and a rollback, learn how to expose our application to the world and how to mount persistent storage. At the end, time permitting, we’ll talk about autoscaling, networking and integration into private clouds.

Please note that for this workshop you need either a Linux or Mac OS X system (if running Windows we recommend using a virtual machine). If possible, please pre-install awscli (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html), kubectl (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and kops (https://github.com/kubernetes/kops#installing) prior to the workshop.
