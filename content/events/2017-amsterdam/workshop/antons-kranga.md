Serverless Architecture is the latest evolution of cloud native applications. It relies on FaaS* and other cloud services that enables user to write applications in different style than we have done it before. That gives better agility and cost to operate, however comes with its drawbacks.

 Being one of the first Serverless Architecture adopters at large scale Antons have got an experience that he would like to share as well as implementation recipes with the community. Planned structure: -

 - Serverless Motivation

 - Introduction into workshop case study and tool chain

 - LIVE coding and implementation of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, KMS, storage and other related services (if workshop),

 - Serverless Architectures blueprints

 - Serverless Takeways
