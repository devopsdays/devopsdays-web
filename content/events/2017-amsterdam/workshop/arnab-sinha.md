Ansible is easy to learn but learn by doing!

For enterprises, learning is an investment which involves, infrastructure, material, setup and effort.

We created an Ansible Training Lab to train a huge workforce using Ansible & Docker.

From bootstrapping a machine to setup of the complete lab takes ~ 1 minute. The lab is scalable on the fly, leverages the idempotency feature of Ansible as its best. Every student has his/her own sandbox and extreme LEAN Infra usage. A plethora of tags in the lab setup playbook brings various functionalities at your finger tips, like SSH Key refresh, dynamic scale-up/scale-down of control and managed nodes for the students, private network setup, scale-up/scale-down of participants and many more...

Join in, see it, do it, feel it, enjoy it & hack it!
