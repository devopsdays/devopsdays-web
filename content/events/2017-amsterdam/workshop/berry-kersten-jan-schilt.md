Do you recognize this?
Business are demanding ever shorter release cycles for new applications. Traditionally ‘Operations’ is seen as a barrier with lengthy bureaucratic controls and delays in provisioning production systems. DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations to deliver high quality software.

However, this requires a mindset shift, new behaviors and a cultural shift in both Development and Operations. Traditionally suspicious of each other, they must now work closely together. Yet many companies are struggling to adopt and deploy DevOps and how to change the culture.

Do you want to change this?
DevOps is more than just the ‘method’. It’s a professional movement that requires a transformation of People Process and Technology. This People aspect is crucial. It requires a change in behavior and the development of new competences.

Follow our session!
Since DevOps is also about continuous Learning and Experimenting, this 2,5 hours DevOps simulation will show participants how to develop high performing teams and make sure we deploy fast and without errors and also work on the right competences.

This simulation is built by GamingWorks and based on the famous book by Gene Kim “The Phoenix Project”. Many organizations start ‘working’ with DevOps and this simulation can help to understand it better and learn how to start this kind of programs.
