We work with technology every day, but we often donâ€™t stop to think about how technology is impacting us as Humans. How do the processes we implement, tools we use and ways we communicate (with each other and with our platforms) impact our health and happiness?

This workshop aims to provide attendees with an overview of the science behind HumanOps as well as equipping them with tools and techniques they can take back to their teams to take a more Human approach to DevOps.

This workshop will be facilitated by Dr Lawrence Ampofo (founder of Digital Mindfulness) and Hannah Foxwell (Product Manager at Server Density).
