Do you write tests with Protractor, Selenium, Androids Espresso or other frameworks? What if you could use those to start your security testing? Join us in this workshop where we show you how you can use your functional / E2E tests to start testing the security of your back-end!

Weâ€™ll guide you through some of the most often found security issues and explain them along the way.
