It's not continuous delivery if you can't deploy right now.

In this hands on workshop we'll configure an entire CD pipeline from first code commit to production deployment.

We'll show how to... - Promote trusted artifacts to ensure only the ""right thing"" is installed. - Use parallel pipelines to run every test every time even if they are defined by other groups. - Define several different types of pipelines such as security and performance - Configure roles and permissions to make sure people are empowered to do what they need to

...all so that we can have the confidence to deploy right now.
