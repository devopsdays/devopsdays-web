One of the hottest and most widely used tools for log monitoring and analytics at the moment is the Elastic Stack:

 * Elasticsearch doing the hard work of analyzing and searching large amounts of data.
 * Logstash for parsing and enrichment.
 * Beats as a lightweight agent or forwarder.
 * Kibana for powerful visualizations.

 This workshop gives you an overview of the four technologies, how they are working together, and how you can manage logs and metrics with them.
