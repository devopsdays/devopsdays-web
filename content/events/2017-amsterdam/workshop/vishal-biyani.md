The workshop will start with setting up a Kubernetes cluster and understanding the components of the architecture. We will show how to interact with Kubernetes with Kubectl & API. Next we will cover basic types such as POD, ReplicaSet, Service, Ingress, StatefulSet, Labels & selectors in concept and one sample of each deployed to a live cluster. Next we will compose an application composed of various types we discussed earlier and deploy to cluster. The last section will cover areas such as networking, storage, integration with the underlying cloud provider and one sample each.
