## Airport

There is a taxi stand outside of the baggage claim at the airport, and most taxi companies have a flat, standard rate from the airport to Midtown of $32. You could pay a little less or a little more, but please be aware of the taxi that you choose: ensure that it’s a legitimate taxi company and agree upon how the price will be determined (flat rate or meter) before putting your luggage inside. If you need help, do not hesitate to ask an airport employee; we’re known to be polite here in Georgia! Unfortunately, [ride-share companies like Uber](http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/24/business/taxi-and-uber-fight-curb-atlanta-airport) are not allowed to pick-up customers at the airport.

## Public Transportation

[MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/) serves the Historic Academy of Medicine. Follow the signs from baggage claim at the airport to get to the MARTA station. From the Hartsfield International Airport station ride MARTA to Midtown Station. The Historic Academy of Medicine is less than a quarter-mile walk from Midtown station, or you can ride the [Georgia Tech Trolly](http://pts.gatech.edu/Documents/trolley%20rambler%2014%2015%20map.pdf) to the event location.
