Many DevOps practitioners and advocates are blessed with operations
teams on one one side and developemnt on the other. Some control the
budget for dedicated hardware and support contracts for the tools they
utilize. This can contrast sharply with small companies where DevOps is
the only team out of necessity, and budgets can be lean. Fortunately, no
company is too small to start leveraging DevOps methodologies for faster
development _and_ better uptime.

Is this talk, we'll talk about some techniques that smaller teams can
use, and how those techniques can evolve over time to soothe the pain
and surface the assumptions that are embedded in the tangled webs we
weave. Real-life case studies will provide the seasoning for some of
these techniques, and hopefully avert a pager buzz or two along the way.
