Brian studied political science in college, but when his thesis contained more python code than prose it was clear where his true loyalties lay. He’s worked in operations roles for the past eight years and currently carries the pager for Eventbrite.

He lives in Nashville, TN with his wife, son, two cats, and collection of 1990s Unix workstations.
