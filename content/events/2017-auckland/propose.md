Hi there! We're excited that you want to be a speaker at our conference, DevOpsDays Auckland 2017 is a single track conference and we are looking for proposals for the conference. We welcome you to our stage: from expert level speakers to absolute beginners who have never given a talk before.

### We are seeking interest in the following types of presentations.

* Talk/panel for the conference main track. These are 35 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.
* Ignite talk that will be presented during the Ignite sessions. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room.

Here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

* _broad appeal:_ How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
* _new local presenters:_ You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area.
* _under-represented voices:_ We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you’re in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you’re in a large, traditional organization, or you’re the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
* _original content:_ We prefer talks not already presented at another event, especially another one in the local area or one available in recorded form.
* _no third-party submissions:_ If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you’ve already shown that as a speaker you’re distant from the process. This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees.
* _no vendor pitches:_ As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.

### General Guidelines

* We strongly encourage potential speakers to submit more than one submission on more than one topic. The more submissions you contribute, the more options you give us to pick you. Be sure your talk title and abstract define the exact topic you want to talk about and what you hope people will learn from the session.
* All presentations must conform to the [code of conduct](www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-auckland/conduct).
