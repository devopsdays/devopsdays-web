## Diversity Scholarship Information
The DevOpsDays Auckland's diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend DevOpsDays events for financial reasons.

Equal access and diversity are important to the DevOpsDays Auckland conference, and we aim to remove this obstacle. We want you at our events, and we want to help you get there!
Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection is limited and will be made by a group of reviewers who will assess each applicant's request.

Scholarship recipients will receive a complimentary registration pass (non-transferrable). Please note, **travel expenses and accommodations are not covered under this scholarship** and are the responsibility of the scholarship recipient.
 
### Eligibility
Applicants must be from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of colour, and/or persons with disabilities; and be unable to attend without some financial assistance.
