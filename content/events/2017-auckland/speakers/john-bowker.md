I’ve had a varied career in IT spanning the development and infrastructure sides of the industry.

7 years were spent in the online gaming industry where I developed and later lead a team developing online poker rooms. After this I changed industries and countries and went to work for Gameloft in Montreal as their Release Manager. I now have a love/hate relationship with Canadian snow.

After surviving various degrees of coldness I relocated to New Zealand and started working for Xero and lead their DevOps enablement team and later moved into the Product Owner for Data where my teams manage the data infrastructure that runs Beautiful Accounting Software.

Oh and a big fan (not expert just competent) of python after spending many years in the C++, Java and Actionscript world; each day I use Flask is a delight.
