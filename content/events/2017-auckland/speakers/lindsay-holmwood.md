Lindsay Holmwood is an engineering leader based in the Blue Mountains, just outside of Sydney. He served as the Head of Technology at the Australian federal government’s Digital Transformation Agency, where he was responsible for technology strategy, advice, and delivery across the organisation.

Since bringing DevOps to Australia by running the second ever DevOpsDays conference in 2010, he runs the monthly Sydney DevOps meetup (the longest running DevOps meetup in the world), and is the secretary of DevOps Australia.

Lindsay has deep and wide experience building highly reliable systems (the open source Flapjack alert routing tool used by Bank of America, Disney Online Services), and high transaction e-commerce platforms (achieving five-nines uptime for Movember while growing donations from $25M to $124M over three years).

He regularly speaks locally and abroad on technology culture, DevOps, digital transformation, and building high performing teams. He also won third place at the 1996 Sydney Royal Easter Show LEGO building competition.
