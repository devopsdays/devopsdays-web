DevOps in New Zealand is hitting critical mass, reaching all aspects of the technology space - from banking institutions to government departments, to SaaS providers, to disruptive startups. DevOps is the new black.


Returning to Auckland after a four year hiatus, DevOpsDays provides an opportunity to expose your brand to the DevOps community across NZ - whether you're looking for talent, wanting to extend the reach of your brand or just show the latest and greatest wares. Sponsoring DevOpsDays in Auckland is a unique occasion to interact with technology professionals and gives your representatives a chance to connect with participants.

DevOpsDays Auckland will be held at Ellerslie Event Centre, at the Ellerslie Racecourse on the 3rd &amp; 4th October and we are expecting about 300 participants. Support DevOpsDays Auckland now to garner the attention you’ll receive for being an early sponsor.

<hr/>

Sponsors are much appreciated for their financial assistance. Sponsorship is the main source of funding for the conference, with registration fees kept low to encourage broad community participation.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees. The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
