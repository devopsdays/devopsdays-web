In order to achieve true continuous delivery, organizations must rethink the way they carry out quality assurance (QA) today. To continuously deliver software, organizations need to make sure tests, procedures and processes around quality are designed to fit inline with the flow of development, integration and deployment.

A continuous testing process encompasses other QA activities that impact overall product quality. As such, continuous testing depends on four major pillars. Jaco will share what these four pillars are and how to deliver them inline within their development cadence.
