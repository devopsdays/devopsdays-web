We have been running Kubernetes at Superbalist for about a year now. Along the way I've picked up useful tid tibs for local development with Kubernetes in Minikube. I plan to share these while briefly detailing the most interesting features of Minikube. The talk includes tools and commands I find most useful as a developer working with Kubernetes, some common issues running a local cluster and my debugging strategies.
