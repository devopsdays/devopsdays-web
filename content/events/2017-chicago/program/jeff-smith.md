 We spend so much of our time talking about distributed computing systems and their various components that we often lose sight of the human systems that drive their design. How can our knowledge about systems thinking in the computing world be applied to the often invisible systems that we operate in every day? Together we'll explore the core concepts of systems thinking, how we apply that to computing systems. Then we'll illuminate some of the human systems that drive our behaviors and what our new found knowledge can do to make these systems more efficient.
