Have you ever been pressed in your career about whether you want to go into management or be technical? I get asked this a lot. My answer is always, “why do I have to choose?” I’ll like to dive into the root of this question and then cover ways in which you can be a leader and still be a technical contributor. It’s a challenge, but certainly possible. I’ll draw on my experience over the last five years at Puppet, Inc.

Items Covered:

* What is technical work anyway?
* Prioritization is most important
* Check your title when doing technical work
* Don’t put yourself on critical path
* Don’t fall into micromanagement designs
* How are you improving those around you?
