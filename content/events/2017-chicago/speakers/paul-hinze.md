In his career, Paul has been consistently drawn to Production: its affinity for chaos, its unforgiving nature, and ultimately its deep longing for attention. This has gotten him into trouble again and again. Once, he found himself in charge of production operations at a payments company. Then he stumbled on a globally scaled AWS application, where he worked on deployment and automation. Today, Paul has finally embraced his true nature at HashiCorp, where he works on tools that help others who feel the same call of Production.
