Rhea is the Director of Site Reliability Engineering at ActiveCampaign. Prior to working in the SRE/DevOps space, Rhea started her career as a high school math teacher before transitioning to technology consulting. A consultant for 7 years, Rhea made the decision to follow her gut to become a DBA, which is where her interest in DevOps started. When she’s not devopsing, she lives at the wood shop, creating furniture and turning functional and decorative “art” with occasional breaks to see her cats and dog.
