Hiya! I’m Soo Choi and I am part of the Devops Research and Assessment team aka [DORA](http://devops-research.com/). In the past, I’ve been a Sr Product Manager at Chef Software, Senior Director at Rackspace for OpenStack products, a co-founder and COO of Anso Labs, and a Program Manager at NASA. In my spare time, I enjoy chasing my children around in Northern California coast and doing anything related to Hawaii.
