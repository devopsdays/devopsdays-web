##### TALK DESCRIPTION

We will take you through the challenges and successes of Capital One’s DevOps Transformation. We are going to talk about the culture changes that have been necessary and how we have adapted our processes and tools to support this culture change.

This talk will go through how we organizationally changed how we did work and how we adapted to a devops model. We will talk about where we have failed and have had to regroup and also what fundamental process and tools. This will include how we enabled an automated deployment model while maintaining change controls and how we rallied around fully automated deployments.
