## DIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION
<br>
The devopsdays DFW community is always seeking to help the underrepresented diverse and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities. We value everyone's opinion, thought, and experience. We recognize that one barrier to attending conferences is that people may not have the privilege of working at a company that can afford them to attend, are self-employed or students with a limited budget to pay for admissions.

Share why you are an awesome example of diversity within the devopsdays DFW community for a chance to receive a complimentary pass to devopsdays DFW 2017 conference. Make sure you submit your application before the July 30th deadline, to get your chance to join all of us at Capital One Conference Center in Plano, TX.  Fill out the following form:
