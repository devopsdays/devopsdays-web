We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please <a href="https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2017/dallas/DevOpsDays_Dallas_2017_Sponsor_Prospectus.pdf">check out our prospectus</a> or drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}.

<hr>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<br><br>
Gold and Platinum sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<br><br>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

<p>In February 2017, the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417">latest forecast</a> by market research firm <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3616417">Gartner</a> stated, <i>“The highest growth will come from cloud system infrastructure services (<a href="http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas/">infrastructure as a service</a> [IaaS]), which is projected to grow 36.8 percent in 2017 to reach $34.6 billion.“</i> Cloud migrations employing DevOps will have the scalability and long-term staying power over companies who refuse to embrace DevOps.
</p>
<p>
The majority of these enterprise companies have two things common: development and operations. This is why 2017 is the perfect opportunity to sponsor DevOpsDays DFW. We anticipate attendance will quickly reach the venue’s full capacity of 400 enthusiastic IT professionals with over 2,400 technology companies in Dallas metro area. The majority of attendees supporting this conference are part of a growing community of DevOps professionals, Agile leaders, Scrum masters, Open Source developers, and Cloud experts.
</p>
<p>
Sponsors of DevOpsDays DFW will have the opportunity to talk with other practitioners, managers, and executives from companies of all sizes. Industries include retail, banking, medical technology, and consulting as well as the academic and public sectors.
Whether your goals include recruiting new talent, opening new markets, or connecting with existing customers, this event will be the place for conversations with experts and leaders on the cutting edge of technology innovation.
This year we have the privilege of hosting devopsdays DFW at Capital One Conference Center (Platinum Sponsor). The sponsors will be in the middle of the action, with traffic flow designed to ensure that attendees will be able to easily engage with sponsors.
</p>
<p>
  There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. We'll have sponsors for various events with special privileges for the sponsors of these events. If you are interested in special sponsorships or have a creative idea about how you can support the event, send us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}.
