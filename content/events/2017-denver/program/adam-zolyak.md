Playing games isn't just for kids!  Playing games can provide a fun and engaging way for us to learn, explore, and collaborate.  In fact, there a whole set of Innovation Games (http://www.innovationgames.com/) that can be used by teams to discover, shape, and prioritize their backlogs to work on the most valuable things.
