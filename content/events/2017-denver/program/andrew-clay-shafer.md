Everybody wants to go to heaven, but none of them want to die. Is there some way we can have the devops and not change anything? Is there some way we can buy the devops and rub it all over everything?

We know there must be a better way but often can't change. Devops initiatives become an intractable collection of compromises between the past and the future. Some focus on the tools, some focus on the people, most focus on what seems most comfortable to them. Is there a way to take theory and practice beyond tribal pop cultures? Should there be? Devops is attained, not when there is no more tools and processes to add, but when there is nothing more to take away.
