This talk will discuss how new technologies can be added to an existing technology stack, and how old ones should be retired.
It bring a lot of lessons learned at Etsy over 7 years, and explains how the architecture review process worked there.
The audience should walk away with a better idea of how to integrate new technologies into their existing systems, when to decide it's right to do it, and how to remove existing legacy systems.
