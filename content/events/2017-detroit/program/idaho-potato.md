He said there were three kinds of Taters. What kind are you?

This is just a fun talk to get people to think about doing and not just watching. Active, not passive. As much as I love to go to a Columbus Symphony Orchestra concert, it's much better to play in the community band, even though I'm not nearly as good. It's good to go to DevOpsDays, but it can be even better to participate - either as a speaker or as a volunteer.

This is a call to action.
