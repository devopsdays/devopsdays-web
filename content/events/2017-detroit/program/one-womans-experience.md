I would like to share some of my experiences as a woman through the different phases of the software industry. Some of the highlights and my attempts to implement change that I would talk about would come from my experiences in the following:
•        Bell Labs during the early days of Unix
•        At&T during Divestiture
•        Silicon Valley (interesting anytime)
•        Starting InfoShark and getting venture capital
•        Teaching High School Math with On-line Learning 
•        Working at SJ Technologies with John Willis on DevOps Services

Along the way, I was able to implement automated technology in a large organization at AT&T. Since this required organizational change I had to come up with what where some revolutionary ideas at the time. One of those ideas was developing a team involving all the stakeholders such as end users. I wrote a book about this experience, Agents of Change: Managing the Introduction of Automated Tools. I would like to end with a quote from Agents of Change: “Another group you should seriously consider including on the team is operations. For some reason, this group is usually ignored…”

I would be honored to share my experiences with the DevOps community.
