Growing up I wanted to follow my father's footsteps and become private pilot and airline mechanic. While my career path deviated somewhat, I still find the parallels between aviation and software delivery to be uncanny. Both fields require strong discipline in communication, testing, and redundancy. Whether you are pushing to the cloud or just flying through it, the lessons learned in the aviation industry hold true and can improve your product and teams for the better.
