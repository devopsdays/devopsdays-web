I have been in the software industry for over 35 years and have had the privilege of experiencing the software industry as it grew. My career began as a software engineer at Bell Labs in the early days of Unix and at AT&T during divesture. I also worked in the Silicon Valley and started my own company, InfoShark. I then took a sabbatical and taught High School Math where I was involved with on-line learning. My daughter, Karen Lawton, who is CEO of SJ Technologies, recruited me back into software business. Currently I am working in the DevOps world with John Willis.

While at AT&T I introduced automated tools to a large organization which required an organizational change. I wrote a book about this experience: Agents of Change: Managing the Introduction of Automated Tools
