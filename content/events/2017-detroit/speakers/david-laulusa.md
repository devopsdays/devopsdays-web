David Laulusa has been working at ICC since the beginning of the year in the DevOps Practice. He has worked at Bell Labs, SAP and whole slew of companies in between. Three years ago when he started working at SAP, his boss handed him The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim and Continuous Delivery by Jez Humble and said, “Read these and figure out this DevOps thing.” And he hasn’t stopped learning since.

David has been a member of the DevOpsDays Ohio organizing committee since it's inception. He's also Co-Organizer of the DevOps Columbus Meetup.
