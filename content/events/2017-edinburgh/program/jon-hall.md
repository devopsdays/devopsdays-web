As enterprises transform around software-led innovation, DevOps teams start to need to deal with customer support at scale, while IT Service Management needs to adapt to a new, fast-moving reality of increased developer autonomy and collaboration. One significant challenge is that ubiquitous multi-tiered structure of support team organisation, which, this presentation argues, is fundamentally incompatible with the DevOps philosophy. We propose its replacement with Swarming, a methodology that harnesses and enables the benefits of DevOps, while doing so on an Enterprise support scale.
