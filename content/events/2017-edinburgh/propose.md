<h3>We want to hear from you!</h3>
<b>We are devoted to inclusivity and welcome talk proposals from anyone who wishes to tender, regardless of race, gender or experience.</b>  All proposals will be anonymised before review. Our anonymity process will involve stripping any identifiable information from proposals including name, gender, geography and company.
<br>
<br>
The people involved in anonymising the proposals will not be involved in their selection. Once the proposals have been anonymised, a team of reviewers will individually rate and categorise all proposals before coming together to discuss each category. Our team of reviewers will include members from under-represented groups. A draft conference program will follow and submitters will be notified via email before the program is finalised and announced.

<h3>Session Formats</h3>
<br>
Devopsdays Edinburgh is a single track, two-day event. The format will include main track presentations, <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format">Ignite talks</a>, and <a href="pages/open-space-format">Open Spaces sessions</a>, i.e.
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A 30-minute talk or panel</em></strong> presented during the conference, usually in the mornings.  These are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all delegates. We welcome all submissions.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> presented during the <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format">Ignite sessions</a> (scheduling varies). These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total), also presented to all attendees in main conference room. We welcome all submissions.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Open Space</em></strong>: The <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions allow you to propose, lead or participate in open group discussions. It is not necessary to propose topics ahead of time - these can be suggested in person at the conference.</li>
</ol>
If you would like to <strong>demo</strong> a product or service at devopsdays then we encourage you to <a href="../sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and set up demos at your dedicated sponsor's booth/table, where you will be able to engage directly with fellow engineers.

<h3>How to submit a proposal</h3>

To propose a talk or ignite, please fill out the <b><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/5HQkomOad6JfX1an1" target="_blank">application form</a></b>

<em>Some advice for your submission:</em>
<ul>
	<li>It's always great to be specific; the more you can tell us the better, but please do keep it concise (e.g. 20 or so lines should be enough).</li>
	<li>Detail is awesome, but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting to conference attendees.</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals from the same person are most definitely welcome - please just perform multiple submissions (i.e. one per proposal) as that would help us out massively in the selection process.</li> 
</ul>

<hr/>
<h3>Selection Considerations</h3>
Choosing talks is part art and part science; here are some factors we consider when considering our program:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Broad appeal:</strong> How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of skills and backgrounds?</li>
  <li><strong>Under-represented voices:</strong> We want to hear all voices and strongly encourage diversity in all forms; you are the only one who can tell your story.</li>
  <li><strong>Original content:</strong> We will lean towards original talks, those that have not already been presented at other (especially local) events and those not available as online recordedings.</li>
  <li><strong>No vendor pitches:</strong> We value our vendors and sponsors; however we will not accept a talk that appears to be a sales pitch. If you would like to demo your product or service, please consider sponsoring the event instead. This will provide a more direct level of engagement with attendees.</li>
  <li><strong>No third-party submissions:</strong> This is a small community-driven event and want to hear from speakers who are engaging with us directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Travel Expenses</h3>
Speakers at Devopsdays Edinburgh will receive a free ticket for the 2-day conference. We also feel you should not incur out-of-pocket travel expenses in order to participate, so if your employer is unable to cover your travel expenses then we may be able to help.
