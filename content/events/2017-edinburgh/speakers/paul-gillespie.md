Paul is the Developer Enablement tribe lead at Skyscanner where he helps guide a number of cross functional teams who work on enabling the product engineering organisation to design, develop and operate their services at scale across multiple AWS regions and data centers.

Over the past 20 years Paul has worked in a diverse range of industries from power utilities, to mobile gaming (remember WAP?) to travel meta search. Early in his career he realized that he hated error prone, manual processes and decide that the world would be a better place with just a little bit more automation and more diverse teams.

Paul's interest include automation, distributed computing, micro-services, cloud computing, Web scale infrastructure and system architecture.
