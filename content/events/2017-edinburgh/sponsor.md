<h2>Why sponsor us?</h2>
Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them.  We depend on sponsorship, we are not-for-profit, and the organisers are all working people who are active in the Tech community and passionate about getting DevOps right.  We do not sell product presentations, nor will we distribute attendee contact lists.
<br>
<br>
Devopsdays is a great opportunity to network and build relationships with highly motivated specialists within the DevOps community; share your lessons learned; promote your brand and recruitment activities; and contribute to important discussions about diversity, burnout, and organisational transformation.  All sponsors are encouraged to participate in break-out sessions and generally engage with conference the attendees as peers, heavy marketing typically works against you when trying to make a good impression at devopsdays conferences.

If you are interested in one of the medal packages below, offering a special sponsorship, or have creative ideas about how you could support the event in another way then please do drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}
