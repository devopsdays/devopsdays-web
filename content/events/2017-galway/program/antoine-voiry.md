<p>In the past 3 years, my team assisted many teams in their DEVOPS transformation internally and externally.</p>

<p>A common pattern in slow adoption or failures is what I am calling the "I can't do it because".</p>

<p>Here are some real life examples, which all start with "I can't do DEVOPS because":</p>
<ul>
  <li>I don't have time</li>
  <li>my company is constrained by very strict audit requirements</li>
  <li>I am working on a legacy platform</li>
  <li>my team doesn't have the knowledge in Docker, Ansible, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>A successful DEVOPS journey is predicated to enabling a change in culture and mind-set. A successful organization need to address those concerns without losing capabilities or compliancy.</p>

<p>These changes will force people in the organization to think differently and to consider constraints as opportunities to automate. This will enable long term changes in the work environment.</p>

<p>We'll focus on demonstrating how we can achieve success by de-bunking those myths and enabling the right culture.</p>
