<p>One of my first memories from my DevOps journey, was hearing the statement ""DevOps is primarily a mind-set"". Coming from an Operations focused background, at the time I didn't fully understand the significance of this statement. </p>

<p>Over the past several months, we have been developing a solution to help promote DevOps within our client delivery organisation, while helping to bridge the gap between our Development & Operations teams. By developing an Enterprise focused Continuous Delivery Platform, and offering it  as a Service, we aim to standardize the Continuous Delivery pipeline within our organisation.</p>

<p>The road is long, and our journey has only begun, but at this early stage we are already excited about streamlining our processes and creating a common culture.</p>
