<p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) allows customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Operating a service which holds these complexities in itself can become challenging.  We need to answer a lot of questions beforehand like, how we decide when to deploy what? How and what to monitor for these huge and complex components? When shall we get paged? Why not  staging environments? and many more.</p>

<p>This talk is about experiments and innovations that we have done to ease life of DevOps of Pivotal Cloud Foundry. How did we evolve from dealing with overwhelming context to a fairly successful Devops team, whose feedback is very valuable for R&D teams in the organization.</p>
