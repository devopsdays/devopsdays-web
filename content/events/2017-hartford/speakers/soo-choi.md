Hiya! I’m Soo Choi and I am part of Devops Research and Assessment team aka DORA. I love running engineering and product teams. In the past, I’ve been a Sr Product Manager at Chef Software, Senior Director at Rackspace for OpenStack products, a Co-Founder and COO of Anso Labs, and a Program Manager at NASA. In my spare time, I enjoy chasing my two children around in Northern California coast.
