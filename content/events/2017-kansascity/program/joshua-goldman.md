Did someone hand your VP of Software Engineering a copy of Google's SRE or The Phoenix Project/Devops Handbook?  They loved it so much and decided now is a good time to refactor your organization? 

Well that happened to us; it happened to me.  I was an "Application Support Engineer", a fancy title for restarting applications till they magically work again.   Now I lead an SRE team.  Half of my team came from an operations role and the other came from development world.   There are so many new things to learn.  What can I do to keep up?  What if I get fired? 

Topics
*Addressing Change Resistance
*Skills development plan
*Getting Developers to be on call
*Getting Operations folks to do code reviews
*Managing stress and preventing burnout
*New career expectations
*What about compensation?

Many companies are treading towards DevOps culture.  They may not necessarily know what that means or may not execute it correctly.   If I've learned anything over the past few years is that no one has it 100% right but we can all share and help each other out.
