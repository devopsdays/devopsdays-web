I am currently a DevOps engineer at Pinsightmedia. I spend most days knee deep in building out a better way to do configuration management while automating all my daily task. If I’m not reading up on how to improve the company DevOps culture I’m working on my self-reflection of being a developer that balances an operations role. Ricky and Morty are life and shorts should always be allowed at the office
