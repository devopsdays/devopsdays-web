As student Richard Feynman had an unorthodox approach to mathematics. Later he would frequently stun his famous and well established colleagues — simply by using tools from a different box.

We have very different tools — and methods in Dev & Ops. Much of DevOps has been to transfer methods and tools from Dev to Ops. But coming *from* Ops, I'd like to think that there are things Devs can learn from their Ops colleagues.

In this talk I'd like to talk about what Ops folk can bring to a Dev position, and what habits we best leave behind.
