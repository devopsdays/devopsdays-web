People often think of boredom as a bad thing: I'll argue that in systems design and operations, it can actually be a virtue:

Boredom is the motivation that leads us to automate the things we find ourselves doing frequently.

Software, frameworks or services that are "boring" often seem that way because they're predictable, reliable and trustworthy.

Bored is the ideal state for an on-call engineer.

I'll make the case that we should ration our excitement, saving it for the things that differentiate us from the competition.
