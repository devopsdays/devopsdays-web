There is much discussion about systemic actions and attitudes that have been the basis for so much homogeneity and exclusiveness in large corporations. Patriarchy. Ageism. Cultural Biases. 

But according to a recent​ ​McKinsey & Company study​, companies in the top quarter for racial diversity are 35% more likely to have financial returns higher than the national median in their industry, while gender diversity boosts performance by an additional 15%. 


So what if we take the mathematical processes that built up those systemic attitudes as the norm, and break them down to their theoretical origins, in order to recalculate a sustainable procedure that would intentionally include diversity, equity and inclusion in its make-up? 

And then make that the new norm? And actually positively affect the bottom-line of the organization? 

Takeaways include: 

● How mathematical theory shows up in human relationships ● What natural pattern-making can be re-worked for team wellness ● Diagramming a defined approach for an inclusive corporate environment for all cultures, disciplines, genders and generations
