Have you ever tried to follow an Agile methodology exactly by the book? I’ve yet to find anyone who has succeeded doing that. Yet we still find people sticking dogmatically to their chosen discipline. Are you tired of looking for that one perfect methodology? Are you more interesting in what an idea can offer than where it came from? Alistair Cockburn’s Oath of Non-Allegiance might be for you. It states: I promise not to exclude from consideration any idea based on its source, but to consider ideas across schools and heritages in order to find the ones that best suit the current situation.

This session will take you on a tour of various methodologies with good ideas to offer, from the obvious DevOps, Scrum and Kanban, through SAFe, Theory of Constraints, ITIL, and others, to the ever-present Waterfall. What ideas can be taken from these methods?
