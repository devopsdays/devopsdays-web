Whilst working in a tiny remote office for a small tech company I started writing sentences on sheets of A4 with a marker pen whenever I learned a hard lesson. I stuck them to the wall with BluTack so I had to look at them and maybe learnt something. Sadly I didn't keep up the practice when I moved onto working in a much larger company and I wish I had.

5 years since I started writing them, I want to go back and revisit a selection, to explain some of the practical things I learn from them, and to challenge or update some of those that were relevant at the time but have not aged well.
