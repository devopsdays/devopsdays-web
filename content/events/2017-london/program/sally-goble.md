The Guardian digital team have worked hard towards implementing Continuous Delivery, and now deploy hundreds of times a day. But if you ship this fast, you need to remove all obstacles to delivery. 
This talk looks looks skeptically at the role of testing in the world of CD, and asks “if can fix it quickly, why does it have to be perfect?" 

It will look at how the move towards rapid deployment changed the way Guardian’s QA team thought about testing - and how they moved from being a conventional pre-release checking-and-testing function to being a team that considers quality in a much more broad sense. 

It will then look at the tools and techniques that the Guardian's quality team use in order to keep their product high without being slowed down by testing.
