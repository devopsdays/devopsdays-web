<h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOEbAXbJP2qNPIATC9WijkJAKJt_AOjxG2yDmrcrZtcrGjvQ/viewform#start=openform">Click here to propose a session</a></h2>

<br/><strong>There are two types:</strong>
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Main talk</em></strong>: 30 minute slots.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Ignite talk</em></strong>: 5 minute slots (presented using the <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite format</a>.)</li>
</ol>

<strong>What the organisers have been blogging about:</strong>

- <a href="https://medium.com/@hannahfoxwell/should-tech-conferences-be-more-inclusive-5a05a09cd302">Should Tech Conferences Be More Inclusive?</a>
- <a href="http://randomness.org.uk/2017/05/21/Anonymising-talk-submissions-for-DevOpsDays-London.html">Anonymising talk submissions for DevOpsDays London</a>
- <a href="https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2017/05/16/transforming-the-future-together/">Thoughts on the theme: Transforming The Future Together</a>


<strong>Our main criteria:</strong>

- _relevant to our theme_: which is 'Transforming the future together'
- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.
- _diversity_: our review process will involve stripping any identifiable information from proposals including name, gender, geography and company.

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.</li>
	<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
