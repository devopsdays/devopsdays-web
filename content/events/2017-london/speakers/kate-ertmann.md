Kate Ertmann is a businesswoman, seasoned speaker, and thought leader. A child actor for kid’s television programming and commercials, Kate renounced her Hollywood hopes in favor of a telecommunications degree from Ohio University. She is one of the founders of Portland’s Women in Animation chapter and is an active member of the her city's Rotary Club. She is a past board member of Bradley Angle, the oldest domestic violence services organization on the west coast, and is currently a board member of Bitch Media, supporting their feminist take on pop culture.

Kate became a partner at Animation Dynamics, Inc in 2000, sole owner in 2008, then sold the company in 2014 to Funnelbox, a strategic video agency. The following year Kate became COO at Qcut, making women’s jeans in 400 sizes to fit 8 different body types and all heights. 

She currently works with a variety of creative and tech organizations focusing on the human side of operational systems and management. Her energetic leadership style can best be defined by the tattoo that runs the length of one arm: a series of mathematical equations that represent movement, followed by the word “GO!”. 

Kate’s favorite food is buttered popcorn.
