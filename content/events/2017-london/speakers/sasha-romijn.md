Sasha is the co-founder and CTO of a small Python/Django development company in Amsterdam. She is deeply involved in the community around Django, a popular Python web framework, chair of the Dutch Django Association, former committer and co-organiser of various conferences. She cares about building communities and conferences in which everyone feels welcome, valued and at home, regardless of their background.

Some of her side projects are the Less Obvious Conference Checklist, with many less obvious suggestions for event organisers, and Happiness Packets, to spread more gratitude and kindness in open source communities.
