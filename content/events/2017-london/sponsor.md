We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email {{< email_organizers >}}.

<hr/>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Some sponsor packages include the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program.  Sponsors will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.  Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<br/>

As this event is for the community and run by volunteers from the community, we are seeking sponsorship to enable us to secure the venue and get started on organising all the other elements that make DevOpsDays such an amazing event.
<br/>

Please see the below details of sponsorship packages. Note that there are a limited number of these available and we have historically seen high demand to sponsor this event so we'd recommend responding early to secure the package you would like.
<br/>

We would also be very grateful for payment terms to be as short as possible as we begin the process of finalising arrangements for the event.
<br/>

Thank you for supporting this event and we look forward to making DevOpsDays London 2017 an inspiring, inclusive and interesting event for everyone.
