    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Making More Open</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>
      A community lead and a continuous integration architect walk into a room and argue about the best practices around developing your infrastructure to support your growth as an open source project.

Items of conversation will include:
* Config management should be path to contribution
* What is access control anyways?
* Why not to give root out like candy
* Discovery for legacy systems
* Internal stakeholder compromises
* Iteration in the open
* What happens when everything is broken?
