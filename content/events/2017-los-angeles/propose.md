<hr>
DevOps Day LA is currently seeking speakers for 10 minute lightening talks.

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _local practioners_: we want to highlight local work by practioners in the Southern California area.
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table.

<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Send an email to [{{< email_proposals >}}] with the following information
<ol>
	<li>Proposal working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Description</li>
</ol>
<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.</li>
	<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
