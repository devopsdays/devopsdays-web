A graduate of UW-Madison’s Computer Science department, Matt Blasinski has been part of the Messaging Team at UW’s Division of Information of Technology (DoIT) for over 15 years. During that time he has built a variety of provisioning and management tools for the messaging systems offered by DoIT. In 2016 he received the University Staff Recognition Award for his work moving campus departments to Office 365. Matt is currently working on replacing many of these tools with containerized versions so that they are more portable, reliable, and maintainable. Outside of work, Matt is an avid cave diver where he puts his experience managing redundant systems, precise planning and attention to detail, and teamwork to good use outside of information technology.
