Mindy is the absolute best cat bed she can be.  She likes networks, embroidery, functional programming, coffee, breaking stuff, jokes, building stuff, riding bicycles, and lots more stuff.  She used to work at a famous container company, a famous English university, an obscure network middlebox company, a Wisconsin- and Iowa-based mid-cap utility company, a graduate space research department, a thrift store, and a smoothie shop.
