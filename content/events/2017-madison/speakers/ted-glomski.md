My name is Ted Glomski and I’ve been a systems administrator in the Madison area for nine years. I have been in a wide variety of different environments - from huge environments supporting tens of thousands of servers, to smaller environments serving small groups, and everywhere in between. Currently I am working at a rapidly growing startup and trying to build a solid foundation for their developers and staff, with a dedication to making the right thing to do the easy thing to do. When I’m not working I’m politically active and playing with puppy dogs.
