DevOps includes developers operating, and operators developing, and everyone crafting code while taking responsibility for what happens when that code is in production.

Operating with insufficient data is a failing proposition; you can’t operate what you can’t measure. So we have to measure things, and measurement starts early in the development lifecycle.

Let’s walk through a brief field guide to the theory and practice of observability, so we can break down the barriers between teams by sharing real actionable introspection about the systems we co-create.
