Going to DevOpsDays is awesome, but it's easy to come away frustrated and feeling like the place where you work is super far behind the times. Every workplace has its own unique set of things that are awful/failing/suck. But that's ok, most everyone is not running 10k containers in production or has a fully-automated deploy process. Embrace the things you have and iterate improvements.
