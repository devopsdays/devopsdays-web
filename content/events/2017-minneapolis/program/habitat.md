Habitat is Chef’s open-source project for application automation.  It simplifies container management by packaging applications in a compact, atomic, and easily auditable format that makes it easier to deploy your application on various container runtimes.  It also helps you run stateful application services (think Redis, Mongo, etc) on cloud instances, VMs, or bare metal. Find out more at [habitat.sh](https://habitat.sh).

This will be a hands-on workshop aimed at anyone involved in building, deploying, or managing applications.  You may be a developer or may come from an infrastructure background. You may currently be working with container technology or a microservices architecture (or planning to).   Habitat helps simplify the processes required to build, deploy, and manage your applications and, if you’re already using containers, even makes containers more awesome.

Prerequisites

Participants should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop.  Participants will be given a remote workstation with all prerequisites installed. The only thing required to access these workstations will be an SSH client (PuTTY on Windows) and familiarity with a interactive text editor (Vi/Vim, Emacs, or Nano).

It's best that participants of this workshop have some familiarity and comfort with the following:

* Writing code (of just about any flavor) in a text editor
* Working on the command line
* Basic system administration – installing packages, configuring those packages, starting service
