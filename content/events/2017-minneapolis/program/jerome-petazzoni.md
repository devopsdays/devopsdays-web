The Docker Engine has native orchestration capabilities since June 2016. It touts unmatched operational simplicity and security, but does it live up to the hype?

That's what we will see in this tutorial. In less than 2 hours, you will setup your own Docker cluster, and use it to "build, ship, and run" from development to production a sample application architectured around microservices.

We will overview the concepts and features of Docker's "Swarm Mode,"including the "least privilege" security model, load balancing, service discovery, rolling upgrades, and much more.

The tutorial will be hands-on; each attendee will be provided with a cluster of Docker nodes running on cloud VMs. The only software required on your machine is a SSH client and a web browser.
