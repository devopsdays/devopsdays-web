We all know “that person”. The “one” that’s more than willing to correct you, publicly or otherwise, with information that is so pure, and 100% unequivocally factually correct. You’ve might have met this person at a Meetup during a social mixer, at a conference, or you encounter them in your everyday work. You might have even dabbled in such behavior in your youth. Maybe in college when you were eagerly filling your head with so much information, you had to just let people see how smart you are. You know “that person”, the “Logically Correct A**hole”.
