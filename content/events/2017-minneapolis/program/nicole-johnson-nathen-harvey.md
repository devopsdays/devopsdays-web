Success with DevOps can be measured with a number of different metrics.  How frequently are systems audited for compliance to various policies?  How long does it take to remediate a failing control or vulnerability?  This workshop provide an introduction to practice of continuous compliance and remediation.  The workshop uses [InSpec](https://www.inspec.io/) and [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) for compliance and remediation, respectively. InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements. Chef is an open-source framework for infrastructure automation.  Easily integrate automated tests that check for adherence to policy into any stage of your deployment pipeline.

During this session, participants will:

* Run InSpec locally on a machine
* Run InSpec on a remote machine
* Use InSpec in the Chef cookbook development process for integration testing

By the end of this class participants will be able to:

* Execute an InSpec test on a local machine
* Execute an InSpec test on a remote machine
* Generate an InSpec profile
* Add InSpec-based integration test to a Chef cookbook
* Run InSpec-based integrations tests during Chef cookbook development

Prerequisites

Participants should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop.  Participants will be given a remote workstation with all prerequisites installed. The only thing required to access these workstations will be an SSH client (PuTTY on Windows) and familiarity with a interactive text editor (Vi/Vim, Emacs, or Nano).

It's best that participants of this workshop have some familiarity and comfort with the following:

* Writing code (of just about any flavor) in a text editor
* Working on the command line
* Basic system administration â€“ installing packages, configuring those packages, starting service
