Christian is an engineer at Nextpoint and an organizer of devopsdays Madison. He's been an ops person for nearly 20 years, only getting out into the wider world of open source recently. He still misses ksh a little. Christian enjoys dancing, live music, board games, and suffers attending to the whims of Prickles the cat.
