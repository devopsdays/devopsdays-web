Jérôme works at Docker, where he helps others to containerize all the things. He was part of the team that built, scaled, and operated the dotCloud PAAS, before it became Docker. When he's not glued to a computer screen, he collects musical instruments. He can passably murder the theme of Zelda on a dozen of them.
