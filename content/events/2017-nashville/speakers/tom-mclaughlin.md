As the Community Engineer at CloudZero, Tom uses his experience in cloud infrastructure and systems development to develop and run serverless systems, and engage the engineering community on this coming technology. He loves exploring serverless architecture and AWS services because he feels this architecture paradigm will produce significant changes and have long lasting effects on cloud computing. When not at work he is a proud cat dad to two calicoes and enjoys spending his time drag racing and sailing. He is also an amateur thinkfluencer on Twitter at @tmclaughbos.
