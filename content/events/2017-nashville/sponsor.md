DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

Sponsors can interact with those interested during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

If you're feeling especially generous, you can sponsor now by using any of the PayPal Links. Our team has a payment processor setup, being managed by <a href="http://www.conferenceops.com">ConferenceOps</a>, and they are handling all financial logistics. We are happy to go through standard company finance processes if need be, and the ConferenceOps team is equipped to help manage that process once your company agrees to sponsorship.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to us at {{< email_organizers >}} if you have any questions we can answer for you.
