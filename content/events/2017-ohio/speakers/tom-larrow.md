Tom took a long meandering career path through television, video game development, motorsports, and manufacturing before ending up as the Deployment and Delivery lead on the KeyBank DevOps team. He writes the continuous integration and delivery scripts to deploy Key's Online Banking platform and numerous other applications to the production Kubernetes environment. He is always tinkering and breaking things, and improving the process by putting things back together in new ways.
