Everywhere we look in the digital economy we find ever-increasing complexity. Our systems and organizations are becoming more interconnected, while at the same time changing more continuously. How do we keep these systems from from flying apart into disembodied pieces? How do we balance agility and autonomy with the need for customer-centered coherency, quality, and value?

Whether it be design systems, change management, or compliance and security, traditional approaches to maintaining consistency break down in the face of complex systems. Forward-thinking companies are tackling this challenge with new methodologies like DevOps, DesignOps, microservices, and cross-functional product teams. While these strategies can enhance speed and responsiveness, they also risk generating new kinds of silos, blockages, and breakdowns.

This talk will present a new model of control that joins together the power and insights of Design Thinking and DevOps. It will introduce the concept of "operationalizing empathy", which lets organizations across the design-operations spectrum create agile governance processes that scale without becoming brittle, slow, or invasive. The talk will describe a set of principles and practices teams can use to continuously align themselves with each other and their customers. It will discuss:

* New ways of thinking and designing needed to manage complex systems
* Strategies for successfully scaling agile practices and cross-functional collaboration 
* Techniques for simultaneously optimizing speed and coherency
