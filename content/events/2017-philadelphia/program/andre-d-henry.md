We do a lot of things in the name of progress. We have Agile, Scrum and as they are applied to Systems Administration we now have DevOps. But why do we do it all, why have we invented and described all new methodologies and processes? Is it to find a perfect budgeting method? Is to to find a perfect plan? Is it to make an on time schedule? Is it to have defect free systems? Those could all be potential side effects, but not the ultimate goal of why we do it all. We don't have time for the five whys, but lets shorten the process and see if we can get to the root of it all.
