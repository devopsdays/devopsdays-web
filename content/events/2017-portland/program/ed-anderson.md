I've been using functions as a service ( AWS Lambda ) for the past several months, and it's led to a very nice flow for devops administrivia.

Even though serverless is a terrible description, and those no-ops people are crazy, functions as a service is still a super interesting approach, especially if you're in the devops world. So many things that we need to accomplish are *event driven*, and we can lower both our capital costs, and our security exposures by using FaaS to accomplish them ( provided that you don't give cloud-admin privileges to your Functions ).
