I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Puppet focused on virtualization and our
physical infrastructure. Prior to joining Puppet I worked in higher education
and with K-12 schools doing everything from desktop support to systems
administration to being the systems architect. During that time I administered
Linux, Mac, Solaris, and Windows in an Active Directory environment. I've also
run data centers, done SAN administration, and implemented and administered
Google Apps aka G Suite.
