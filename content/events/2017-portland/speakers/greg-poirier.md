Greg Poirier is the VP of Engineering and a software engineer at Sensu, Inc. working on the next generation of its popular open source monitoring platform. After years as a systems administrator with no formal education, he sought and received a degree in computer science, and has since been working as a software and systems engineer at companies around the San Francisco Bay Area. When he's not convincing people that containers are awesome, he spends his time in rehearsals with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra Chorus.
