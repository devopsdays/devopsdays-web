Steve has been developing software professionally for more than a decade, working in tech and non-tech organizations alike, of both varying sizes and various stacks. A big-time proponent of (and small-time contributor to) open-source software, he's also a retired ultramarathoner, constantly dreaming of coming out of retirement. Steve lives in Ithaca, NY with his wife and two kids.
