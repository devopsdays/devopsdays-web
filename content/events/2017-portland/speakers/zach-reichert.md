I'm a Senior SDET at Puppet, where I'm responsible for testing the application orchestrator, puppet communication protocol, and PE console. I also develop tools and processes to improve the way we test at Puppet. When I'm not writing a test you'll find me doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice or wrenching on my hobby car when its not so nice.
