We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}.

DevOpsDays is a volunteer organized event for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. All of the talks are selected via an open CFP in order to present the highest quality conference possible. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

Gold sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program. All sponsors will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.

Most sponsors find they get the best response by sending engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

Sponsors are responsible for providing high-res logos for use on the website and in promotional materials.  The preferred file formats are EPS or AI.

There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. If your organization would be interested in sponsoring one of the conference meals, coffee, wifi, or even the evening event, please email {{< email_organizers >}}. If you've got an idea that isn't one of those, let's talk about what you're thinking!
