<p><em>Michael has spoken with several Enterprise Architecture teams over on the changing nature of how Enterprise Architecture help in a DevOps- and cloud-native-driven culture. He will share their experiences including what type of Enterprise Architecture is actually needed, tactics for transitioning and when it's best to just kill off Enterprise Architecture and let the DevOps cowboys run wild.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond the microservices gordian knot nonsense</strong></p>

<p>Current application theory says that all responsibility for software should be pushed down to the actual DevOps-style team writing, delivering, and running the software. This leaves Enterprise Architect role in the dust, effectively killing it off. In addition to this being disquieting to Enterprise Architects out there who have steep mortgage payments and other expensive hobbies, it seems to drop out the original benefits of enterprise architecture, namely oversight of all IT-related activities to make sure things both don't go wrong (e.g., with spending, poor tech choices, problematic integration, etc.) and that things, rather, go right.</p>
