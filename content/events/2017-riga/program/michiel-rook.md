<p><em>Consider a legacy application, no tests, manual releases and low velocity.<br>Learn how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous deployment pipeline. I’ll discuss the process, automated testing, monitoring and trunk based development.</em></p>

<p>It's a situation many of us are familiar with: a large legacy, monolithic application, limited or no tests, slow & manual release process, low velocity, no confidence...  A lot of refactoring is required, but management keeps pushing for new features.</p>

<p>How to proceed? Using examples and lessons learned from a real-world case, I'll show you how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to deliver value from the first sprint. On the way, we’ll take a look at the process, automated testing, monitoring, master/trunk based development and various tips and best practices.</p>
