<p><em>Last 5 years I have spent growing one of biggest DevOps groups in Nordics and maybe even Europe. This talk is my confession about Do's and Dont's, DevOps anti-patterns and the world were DevOps silo could be a good thing.</em></p> 
<p>It also could be called Scaled DevOps but that doesn't cover everything what we do. It has been a journey of 4-5 years going from change to change by experimentation. There are not that many good reads or people where to take advice from how to do this in a large enterprise.</p>
<p>No bulls***, real data, real people.</p>
