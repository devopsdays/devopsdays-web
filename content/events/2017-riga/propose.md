<h2><strong>Have something to share? Submit your proposal <a href="https://www.papercall.io/devopsdays-riga-2017" target="_blank">here on PaperCall.io</a>!</strong></h2>
<hr>

<strong>We’re looking for talks about and around DevOps and we are open for your ideas that can come as a presentation or ignite sessions.</strong>

<h3>Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:</h3>

- _Original content_: content not yet presented at Baltic conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _Presentation skills_: experience in presentations are valued, but new presenters are welcomed as well; we want to hear everybody’s voice
- _No vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don’t think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.

<h3>How to submit a proposal</h3> 

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.papercall.io/devopsdays-riga-2017" target="_blank">PaperCall.io/DevOpsDays-Riga-2017</a> and submit your proposal there with the following information: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Proposal working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Type (presentation or ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
	<li>Links to your previous presentations and/or videos</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any questions, please send an email to [{{< email_proposals >}}].</p>

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.</li>
	<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>

<strong>Please note</strong>: We will not accept any vendor talks or sales pitches. This is not the space for you. If you’re a technology vendor seeking to engage with our attendees, please see our sponsorship page or contact {{< email_organizers >}} for more information.
