<hr>
There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Open Space session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during Open Space. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space explanation</a> for more information.
</ol>

Even if you don't propose, please consider {{< event_link page="proposals" text="commenting on proposals submitted by others" >}}

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.

<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Instructions for submitting your proposal will be made available once the call for proposals is open.   In the meantime, get those proposals ready!
