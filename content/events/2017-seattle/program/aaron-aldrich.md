Incidents happen and most of the time they get handled quickly by an individual or through an automation system. But sometimes none of that works and you need to call in the crisis team. Any highly functional team will need a leader. It's not optional, especially in crisis. Decisions need to be made quickly and someone needs to coordinate efforts rather than getting knee-deep in technical issues.

When should you choose a leader, and when everyone is busy putting out the big fire, what should the leader actually be doing? This talk will explore exactly these questions and what it means to be a leader during crisis response.
