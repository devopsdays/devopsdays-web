Day 2 operations of cloud-native systems such as DC/OS or Kubernetes cover a wide range of activities, from monitoring & logging to upgrades and backup/restoring the platform as well as individual services. We will cover typical requirements and tooling available to devops to successfully perform day 2 operations, discuss good practices in this area and give a live demo of selected topics, such as monitoring with Prometheus and backup/restore with burry.
