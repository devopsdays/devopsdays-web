This talk is an outline of some of the technical and non-technical things that Operation team members can do to continue to make themselves more valuable in their organization. The idea came to me when I was talking with someone who was new to the field that felt Operations work wouldn't exist or it's value would be diminished in the coming years. But there are plenty of things that internal OPS teams can do that will be difficult to commoditize by the likes of Amazon and Google.
