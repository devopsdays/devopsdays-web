This is the bittersweet story of Continuous Integration. CI is practice that we fell in love with, embraced and then never fully committed to. I’ll share with you the current state of CI, what we think we are doing when we say CI and what we are really doing in terms of CI. Then I’ll remind us all why we fell in love with CI in the first place and make some suggestions on how to get back to the good stuff.
