I am a Manager of Software Development at T-Mobile responsible for our continuous integration and deployment efforts. Previous I have worked at REI and West Marine supporting their eCommerce initiatives.

As a development manager with over fifteen years of experience in the eCommerce and IT industry I have developed an extensive understanding of digital spaces. This experience has provided me the capability to effectively lead the strategic development and implementation of many world-class digital experiences.
