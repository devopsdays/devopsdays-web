Banks are being disrupted by fast changing expectation from customers. Most of the banks are struggling due to:
1. Unprecedented demand on their IT (which is tuned towards reliability than speed)
2. Sophisticated technology landscape
3. Thought partnership between business & IT

In our journey towards introducing DevOps in the bank, we experimented and built various tools to bridge the gap between software development and system administration. During this journey we learnt and followed "lean principles" and the paradigm to treat "Infrastructure as Code". This helped in building highly effective continuous delivery process.

The talk will take the audience through the journey we took:
* from separate SysAdmin to integrated Dev & Ops
* from everything manual to treat Infrastructure as Code
* from VM to full containerized microservices
* from manual monitoring to full customer journey mapping
* from just being a sysadmin to become Platform as a Service Provider

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

This talk details the journey we took @BTPN. It will be a learning experience for the audience to understand:
* challenges we faced in this DevOps transformation journey
* balance between going wild introducing new tools and techs
* mindset change
