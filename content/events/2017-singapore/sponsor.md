We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring, please <a href="mailto:organizers-singapore-2017@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor DevOpsDays Singapore 2017">drop us an email</a> or [download the prospectus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B07tYym-SQCFaG03WmJ3ZVFkbG8) right away.

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute the attendee contact lists.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

## Why Sponsor Us?

The DevOpsDays event mandate is to bring the highest quality speakers, experts, and the curious together. This is the third edition of DevOpsDays in Singapore and Southeast Asia.

Singapore is not only one of the fastest growing startup hubs in the world but is also a trusted healthcare, telecom, and financial services nexus in Asia with strong investment in technology from the Government. We aim to attract representation from large enterprises and the startup community alike.

By sponsoring DevOpsDays, you will be exposing your organization’s brand and services to Singapore and Southeast Asia’s top talent in this rapidly growing space.

Sponsoring DevOpsDays Singapore connects your company to some of the greatest technical and business minds in the industry who are influencing decisions in security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and organisational change.

## The Venue

DevOpsDays Singapore 2017 will be held at the Microsoft Operations Offices, #22-01, 1 Marina Blvd, Singapore 018989, in the middle of one of Singapore’s numerous cultural hubs.

Many attractions are within walking distance and the location is well connected with public transport ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/6nFrCeDDUuJ2)).

## Booth Space

Gold and Platinum sponsors receive dedicated booth space at the event. Silver sponsors share a table. This is the perfect spot for your engineers to meet other tech geeks. Your booth space will have a booth table (150 cm x 50 cm) and two chairs. You can set up your table as you like, be it to display signage, products, materials, or swag giveaways. We encourage sponsors to send engineers to interact with attendees during session breaks.

Large displays and oversized marketing material are not allowed in the exhibitor space. Please check with the organizers if your items fall under the restricted category. You may ship your booth materials to the venue prior to the event day.

## Sponsor FAQ

### How big is our booth space?

Gold and Platinum sponsors receive booth space at the event. You will receive a table (150 cm x 50 cm) and two chairs.

### When can we pick our booth spot?

Booths are not selectable. Our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks before the conference date.

You can enter the venue in the morning at 7:30 am to set up your table.

### How many scanners (and which type) do we get?

None. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks and this conference is not a typical conference or convention.

We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the sessions. You are responsible to collect any information you want in person if you want to do giveaways.

### Can we bring a 1m roll-up as our back wall?

Whatever you bring must fit behind or on your table (150 cm x 50 cm).

### Will we have any chairs at our booth?

Each booth comes with 2 chairs.

### Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need the graphics?

You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on or behind the table.

### Do we get any sponsored talks?

No, but you are welcome to submit a proposal for consideration through <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2017-singapore/propose/">our CfP form</a>.

### How many talk tracks do you have?

It's a single-track program. You find more details on the program on {{< event_link page="program" text="our program page" >}}.

### Do we get electricity connection for out booth?

Yes, you will get a power strip (Plug <a href="http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm">Type G</a>).

### Will wifi connection be good enough for showing demos?

There will be wifi available but we recommend to prepare your demos for offline mode because we can not guarantee availability of the network.

### Do we get an advertising in the program? When do you need the graphics?

We will be using the logos that are sent by you (specifications are mentioned in the contract).

### Do we get a dedicated email blast?

No, even better: we will give you a Twitter <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091205132038AA2uqcy">shout out</a>.

### Who should I send?

Not marketing folks. Send your techie geeks that can interact with attendees during the sessions and the breaks.

Invoices will be handled by our conference partner. You will receive an invoice including GST, if applicable.

For this, we need the official business address, full name of your contact and GST number.

Once payment is complete, we will send you an email requesting registration details of the attendees that will use the tickets associated with your sponsorship level.

### How many people do you expect?

We are planning for 200 attendees.

### What kind of attendees will come to the conference?

We are focusing on people who are architecting and building distributed applications or doing migration projects, especially those away from monolithic software. This will typically include Architects, Lead Developers, and IT-Operations.

### Do you have media partners who will cover the conference?

No; however, if you have an idea to support the event in the media, please <a href="mailto:organizers-singapore-2017@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor DevOpsDays Singapore 2017">let us know</a>!
