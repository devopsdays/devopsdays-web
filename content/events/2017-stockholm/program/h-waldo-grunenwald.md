"DevOps Doesn't Work." Whether it's from people who's "DevOps Transformation" consisted of a renaming, or people who scoffed at the idea of letting development deploy to Prod _more_ often, I hear this all the time. And frankly, I'm tired of "What is DevOps" talks.

DevOps is a straw ~~man~~ person. When a SysAdmin says "DevOps doesn't work" or grumbles about giving access to Production to people, the real problem is that historically they have been outnumbered, overridden, and have not had authority aligned with responsibility.

In this talk, I will demonstrate why DevOps doesn't matter, and that focusing on DevOps is missing the point. I will offer practical solutions to the problems of historically poor relations with other teams

* All of the responsibility, none of the authority

* Tragically slim Systems / Ops teams

* Constant Firefighting

I describe how to make things better.
