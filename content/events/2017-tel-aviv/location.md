<p> The Tel Aviv Convention Center is located at the most strategic spot in the metropolis, which allows for quick and easy access to it from any spot in Israel. The major traffic arteries (Ayalon Freeways, Kvish Geha, Kvish Ha’Hof, Kvish Hamesh) flow directly to it, the nearest train station is located within walking distance of the venue, as well as plentiful bus stations.
That, and more – adjacent to the various pavilions visitors can enjoy the hundreds of upper and lower tier parking spaces, with thousands more parking spaces within the perimeter.
