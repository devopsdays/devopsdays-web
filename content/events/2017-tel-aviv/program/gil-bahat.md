Doing Devops in a regulated, old-protocol and cloud-opposed mindset
DevOps is taking the world by storm. or most of it. but can you apply its principals to environments which stake the odds as much as possible against it? This talk will be about trying to do DevOps in environments which are: * Regulated - how to maintain compliance in the face of rapid changes. we’re going to discuss which regulation hurts the most, in what way, and what is the best way to handle the situation. * Old protocols - how do you manage when you don’t have nearly as much ready-made tooling. what’s important to build yourself, what you can adapt and reuse and how to best identify and fill the gaps. * Cloud-opposed mindset - how do you make the cloud appear friendly and familiar to those who shun it. how to alleviate concerns of security and performance from a service.
