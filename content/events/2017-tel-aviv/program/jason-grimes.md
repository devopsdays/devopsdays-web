Concur has recently gone through this digital transformation of the business from a monolith application with 2 major releases per year to each 700+ developers who are committed to owning their own code in Production and owning performance from an end-to-end; giving product teams the ownership from design through production release and operations.

As Concur SRE we are here to put the right talent, practices, strategies, change control and ultimately global teamwork together to run todays high availability production operations business environment.
