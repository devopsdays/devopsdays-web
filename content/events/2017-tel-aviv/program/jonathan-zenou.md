Midburn is the israeli extension of the Burning Man festival. Last year, 11,000 lucky people participated in the event. Because the event is in high demand, there are only two dates during the year one can purchase tickets. Twice a year ~25000 people are trying to access the same web service at exactly the same time. After four years with several failures and a lot of unhappy people unable to buy their tickets, we decided to redesign the whole architecture using only serverless components and to ensure no one will be left behind. This talk will cover the process we’ve been through, which technologies we decided to go with and why we chose those technologies. We will talk about how we tested the new architecture and what happened in real-time.
