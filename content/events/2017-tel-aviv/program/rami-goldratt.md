Innovation does not need to be a magical act of randomness, or dependent on a single person.  It can be the result of structured processes that drives engineers and managers to create the next breakthroughs. The key lies in understanding customer’s limitations better than anyone else (including the customers) and then finding breakthrough ideas to remove these limitations.
