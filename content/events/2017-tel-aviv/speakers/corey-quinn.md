## Keynote Speaker

"Corey has a long and storied history as a consultant -- long, in that every\
  \ year he did it felt like three years, and storied, in that he's got a few. Prior\
  \ to his current role as Director of DevOps at FutureAdvisor, he spent most of the\
  \ past few years at a Bay Area consulting firm, where he served as a systems architect,\
  \ ad-hoc recruiter, advocate for driving transformational change throughout organizations,\
  \ and (due to a misunderstanding around what a \"standup meeting\" really was) an\
  \ improvisational comic. One of the early developers behind Saltstack, Corey also\
  \ has a rich history of contributing to various open source projects.\r\n\r\nCorey's\
  \ hobbies include motorcycles, building custom keyboards, and drinking whiskey--\
  \ it's a shame that they all don't work well together. He lives in San Francisco\
  \ with his wife and two rodents of unusual size masquerading as dogs."
