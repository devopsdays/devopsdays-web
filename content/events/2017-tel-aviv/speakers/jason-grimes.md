I tweet, share on LinkedIn, big fan of GIFs as teaching moments, occasional Snaps, but Insta has my heart. I’m into art, media, music and yes, communication. I’m high energy, generation-xer who spent almost 15 years in the industry before I knew what my gift was. I was always good at Technical Operations, but this new movement this DevOps + SRE speaks to my core of radical evangelical change that companies like Concur need as they transition from the monolith to microservices and true ownership of end-to-end performance. I have the buy in from Execs, the dollars from the Org and the best toolsets in the business, now it’s up to us to champion best practices for the org of more than 700+ Developers worldwide.
