Join us to hear how Shomi.com, now defunct over the top video service, migrated their production workload (700+ EC2 instances) to AWS in two months with no downtime, while building a DevOps culture of transparency, and having a lot of fun as they learned. We will tell you what worked and what didn't and where Shomi was going when it was finally shut down. Learn the behind story about a technical and people transformation race to the finish line.
