Congratulations! The developers in your organization "operate it" because they "built it": you are finally living the DevOps dream. ... Now what?

Becoming a high-performing organization requires more than just developers. You need a great platform, an effective toolchain, and clear business goals in order to consistently deliver business value and an outstanding customer experience while minimizing work done.

This talk will explore the needs of developers in a DevOps model and how different roles in the organization can rally around them for the benefit of everyone. Oh yeah, it'll also be engaging and funny. Trust me.
