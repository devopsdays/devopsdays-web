In this time of social media-driven news cycles, products' dependency on third-party services, and cutely-named vulnerabilities, you cannot help but be drawn into the downward spiral of Other People's Outages. In this 5 minute talk, we'll explore this professional Schadenfreude and talk about ways to educate and empathize with ourselves, our peers, and an increasingly technologically dependant public.
