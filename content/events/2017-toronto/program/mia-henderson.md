  <h3>A year of containers: the agony and the ecstasy</h3>

<p>Docker Docker Docker! is the driving call these days, but what's it like to actually roll out containers in production with existing applications and infrastructure? How do you get buy-in from development teams? How does docker mix with existing legacy code and infrastructure? What’s the operational experience like for developers who are on-call?</p>

<p>In this talk I'll discuss how PagerDuty migrated a number of existing applications to containerized infrastructure in production, simplifying build and deploy along the way. I will go over the issues we ran into (IPSec + Docker = sad), the tools we created to help, and the benefits we're experiencing, as well as our current work using a container scheduling platform. I’ll also talk about selling docker in an environment where developers are on call for their applications that are now running in containers.</p>

<p>Attendees to this talk will leave with ideas on how to kick-start migration to containers in their organization, as well as the tools they will need to build or find along the way.</p>
