A light technical discussion of some interesting things you can do with docker in a development environment.

I'll share some examples of what has worked well for the teams I've supported, and talk about how it brings the production environment closer to the Developers.

The slide deck will show a series of Development environment complications, and highlight how Docker can be leveraged to solve them.
