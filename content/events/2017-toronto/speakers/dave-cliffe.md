Dave is a software engineer who adopted a more peaceful role on the Product team at PagerDuty (in Toronto), a company whose sole goal is to make the lives of Dev & Ops engineers everywhere a calmer, sanity-filled reality. Before PagerDuty, Dave worked in cloud computing at Microsoft (Windows Azure) and at Amazon.com launching their Grocery business. Frequently, he wonders which is scarier: being on-call during an outage or being a parent. The debate continues.
