## Transportation

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst in the
nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you are visiting
from out of town. Instead, take [Metro](https://www.wmata.com/) to the event.
CapitalOne is located adjacent to the
[McLean](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/mclean.cfm) station, which
is served by Silver line trains.

The nearest airport is [Dulles
(IAD)](http://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport).
If you're arriving at National (DCA), Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station,
Metro's [trip planner](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/trip-planner/)
can help you get to the event.
