DevOpsDays DC 2017 will be held at
[CapitalOne](https://www.capitalone.com/) at 1680 CapitalOne Drive, McLean,
Virginia, just outside the District (but inside the Beltway!)

## Local Hotels

There are a number of hotels near CapitalOne. Stay tuned for details on the
official DevOpsDays DC 2017 hotel block.

## Transportation

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst in the
nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you are visiting
from out of town. Instead, take [Metro](https://www.wmata.com/) to the event.
CapitalOne is located adjacent to the
[McLean](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/mclean.cfm) station, which
is served by Silver line trains.

The nearest airport is [Dulles
(IAD)](http://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport).
If you're arriving at National (DCA), Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station,
Metro's [trip planner](https://www.wmata.com/schedules/trip-planner/)
can help you get to the event.
