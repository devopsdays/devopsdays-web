DevOps Days is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy marketing will probably
work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees. Contact

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends
on your sponsorships to happen. However, because of the nature of the event, we
do not have vendor booths or book product pitches.

Platinum sponsors do get a table they can hang out at and put materials on for
interested people to come visit during breaks, and of course all attendees are
welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is not
'that kind of conference' and heavy marketing will probably work against you
when trying to make a good impression on the attendees. The best thing to do is
send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
