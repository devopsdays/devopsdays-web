In a short ignite talk, I would like to give some inspiration what it means to work together in a devops environment:

* Away from tradtitional management (command & control)
* Towards Devops leadership: The Coach, asking the right question, creating the right environment and the self-organizing team, with a strong improvement culture towards a common vision
* Enriched with some funny anecdotes from my past experience
