Distributed Systems are a complex topic. There's abundant research about it but sometimes 
it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main 
concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to 
start their own research as well. In this talk I will review the different models: 
asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory 
communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different 
kinds of replication.

I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best 
one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to 
solve. The goal of the talk is to set a good foundation for people interested in learning 
more about distributed systems.

Talk objectives:
When learning about Distributed Systems there are lot of books and papers to chose from, 
with many of them having titles that are hard to understand. It's difficult then to judge 
their relevance to our interests if we don't know the topic already. The goal of the talk 
is to lay a common ground for Distributed Systems so everyone can benefit from the current 
research on the topic.

Target audience:
Engineers interested in getting started with Distributed Systems.
