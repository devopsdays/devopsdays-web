Container, Docker, Mesos and Kubernetes are hipster topics right now. Everyone is talking 
about and how awesome and easy it is. Let put everything into production! It needs only 
5 minutes. But is this reality? Is this really that easy? And what are all this container, 
distributed systems and resource scheduling about? Shiny new world or hardcore computer 
science?

This talk is about:

* A brief introduction / overview into containers (Docker) and resource scheduling systems (Mesos)
* Why is this so awesome and why the world needs this
* A few (in production / practical) examples for applications running on these services
* A realistic view at this services (in production)
