Over the last few years we’ve seen an explosion of complexity, in everything from polyglot 
storage to composable infrastructure, containerization and microservices, config management 
vs immutable infrastructure. Until recently there was a set of widely accepted best 
practices for running in the cloud. But now every element of your stack is a never-ending 
rabbit hole of possibilities and questions. What's an engineer or architect or manager to 
do? Solid technical judgment is more important than ever. You can’t anticipate every 
problem, but you can identify and head off many of them in advance. We'll talk about how 
to identify and prioritize where to be boring and where to innovate … and how to correct 
course when you've made a wrong call.
