Data breaches are on the rise and placing increased pressure on Enterprise IT to protect 
the business.  With the rise of DevOps and as hackers takes advantage of known 
vulnerabilities on unpatched or misconfigured systems, Enterprise IT increasingly needs 
to automate vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking. 
OpenSCAP is an opensource tool for automatically verifying the presence of patches, 
checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of 
compromise.

In this presentation, you'll learn about:

* How Containers enable DevOps, Container Technology, and the security risks with deploying containers in the enterprise
* Security vulnerability (CVEs) and Configuration issues (CCEs) notifications and checks
* Automating vulnerability management, security management, and compliance checking with OpenSCAP
* Scanning online and offline Containers and Virtual Machines with OpenSCAP
* Generating and understanding OpenSCAP audit reports
* Customizing OpenSCAP profiles

Join Chris Van Tuin, Chief Technologist, West at Red Hat, as he walks through the inherent 
security risks of deploying containers in the enterprise and how OpenSCAP can help protect 
and secure the business.
