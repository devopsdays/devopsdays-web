I was working in agile projects for more than 10 years now. But I have never been in a 
team reaching the hyper performance phase. Nor while working as number 2 in a start up 
nor in a small team embodied in a multinational global player. With DevOps, new 
specialists joining the team. The diversity grows and that will it not make easier to 
develop such a culture. Kaikaku, that’s the Japanese word for breaking off, doing 
experiments and implement disruptive changes if needed. That’s the recipe to develop a 
highly performing team or to find new ways. I had the chance to learn and implement three 
different methods which support such a culture. The results while applying those methods 
where stunning – positively. My hands-on experience with Lego Serious Play, Complex 
Problem Solving and Foursight have clearly shown, that it is worth to think outside the 
box and to left behind traditional management instruments. Culture is more important than 
before. To build bridges and solutions as a team is a core competence in a DevOps team. 
Those three methods will enrich your way to develop a DevOps culture. In my presentation, 
I will introduce the three methods based on real-life applications and will show you, how 
they can help to build bridges.
