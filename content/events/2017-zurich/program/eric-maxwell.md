Have you heard about Roles in Chef Server? Have you heard that “best practice” says not to 
use them because they’re not versionable? Have you been warned not to store attributes in 
Roles? What if we could have it all? What if we could use Roles that were versionable and 
were safe to store attributes in? Well, you’re in luck — we can! Join me as we dive into 
the Role-Cookbook Pattern and learn that we can, indeed, have our cake and eat it too!

This is a fun and quick talk that introduces people to the role-cookbook pattern.
