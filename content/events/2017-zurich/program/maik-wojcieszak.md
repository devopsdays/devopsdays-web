Fast response to changing markets, flexible automation and cross organizational integration 
are the key features for the industrial landscape of the future. 

I've first learned about DevOps about 2 years ago. With my background of industrial 
automation I felt somehow as a stranger while attending my first DevOps conference. After 
a while it dawned on me that DevOps can solve many problems in my working area. 

This talk is about what I've learned from DevOps. I will describe common problems and 
pitfalls that arise from cross organizational scaling of automation and give a short 
overview of the requirements for a software to support agile management of production 
environments.
