According to Gartner Inc. "By 2020, a corporate 'no-cloud' policy will be as rare as a 
'no-internet' policy is today."

While cloud adoption is increasing steadily by moving workloads away from dedicated, 
on-premise equipment to an IaaS or even PaaS model, the transformation goes on: 
FaaS, also known as "serverless", is the next step in cloud evolution.

Despite all the buzz it is important to understand the different cloud models and pick the 
one that best suits your current needs.

This presentation will shed some light at various customer requirements and demonstrate 
ways to push cloud adoption in a company while taking it one step at a time.
