SIX has started the transformation to DevOps in 2015, being one of the first larger
businesses in the Swiss financial sector to do so. The presentation will show the journey
of one of the DevOps teams – the approach, the results and the learnings on the way from
traditional “silo’ed” organization with waterfall methods to a new cross-functional,
agile team, with a focus on improving speed by eliminating waste and through automation.
