The journey to continuous delivery (CD) is long, winding and always evolving. We thought we 
had achieved all we could with continuous delivery and then… something changed. We soon 
realized that we weren’t doing all we could to continuously deliver. Come learn from my 
experiences at ThoughtWorks as I talk about the lessons we have learned on our CD journey.

Attendees will leave with a set of tips to act as a guide on their journey to continuous 
delivery. I will start at the beginning and define CD, talk about the underlying practices 
and cultures you need to get started and share some tips to take home.
