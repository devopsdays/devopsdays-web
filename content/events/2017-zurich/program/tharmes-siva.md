Businesses want to ensure that their end users are happy so they can maximize productivity,
loyalty, and profits. But poor performing applications cause serious business issues. 
In todayâ€™s DevOps organizations and agile environments, it is essential to ensure application 
performance management throughout the full application lifecycle from the End User to 
Infrastructure.
To achieve this, modern application performance management faces a challenge:

* on one hand, it has to be extremely flexible and agile
* on the other hand has to provide all necessary information on all transactions end-to-end 

in production as well as development and test environments so that people are talking the 
same language. 
 
Because DevOps is about speed and iterations, we will share in this presentation a performance 
management philosophy which will maximize the value of DevOps for high performing applications. 
It allows you to find and fix the things that really matter instead of hunting ghost performance 
problems with your DevOps groups.
