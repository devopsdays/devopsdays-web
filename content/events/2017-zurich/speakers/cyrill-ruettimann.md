Since 5 years, Cyrill works as a consultant at innovation process technology (ipt). His first project puts him in the role of being responsible for the success of a project used in about half of the swiss municipality. This was the start of his passion about DevOps. Since the key success factor was to engage operations from the start of the project. In the last years, Cyrill was engaged at well known swiss brands to help them succeed by developing their own devops movement based on technical, organizational or people patterns. Being passionate about learning new things and ways to resolve challenges, he became a certified Lego Serious Play Practitioner and applied this methodology successfully in his daily work.
