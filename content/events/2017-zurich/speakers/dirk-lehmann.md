I'm doing the technical operations of SAPs cloud based ride sharing solution “TwoGo by SAP”.

I give external talks and presentations (e.g. DevOpsDays Paris 2015, Entwicklertag Karlsruhe,
Beyond Borders MeetUp -DevOps Amsterdam, Continuous Lifecycle 2015, Delivery of Things World 2016)
on Continuous Delivery and DevOps (with focus on large enterprises), as well as SAP
internal workshops on these subjects.
