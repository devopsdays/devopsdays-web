Jorge has been involved with different open source communities for over 10 years. He now drives Sysdig evangelism, showing potential customers and community members best practices adopting DevOps practices, using Kubernetes and monitoring their containers infrastructure.

He enjoys monitoring all the things and DIY projects with Raspberry PI and Arduino. When he is away from computers, you will find him walking with his 2 dogs across the countryside.
