It’s about time you learned how to do serverless, huh?

Come join me for a workshop. We will discuss what makes a (good) REST API, I’ll introduce the basics of all the technologies we will be using, and then we’ll dive in and make one together. At the end of this workshop, you should be confident enough to make your own API. You’ll walk away with a functional prototype which you can use to kick-start your own APIs.

If we have time, towards the end of the talk we can go in more detail on any number of things such as discussing using different data storage technologies (eg: Dynamo), other type of event triggering, custom authentication, caching layers, etc.

We’ll be learning and using following technologies:

* Serverless Framework
* Amazon Web Services
* Python 3.x
* SQLAlchemy
* AWS Lambda
* Docker
* Either Postman or SwaggerHub

To join this workshop, you’ll need the following (1-4 mandatory):
1. Bring your own computer
2. Have an Amazon Web Services account
3. A web browser
4. A text editor of your choice
5. Install the Serverless Framework
6. Setting up an AWS CLI profile tied to your AWS account
7. Install Python 3.6
8. Install Docker
*NOTE*: Everything we do in this workshop will fall under the AWS Free Tier.
