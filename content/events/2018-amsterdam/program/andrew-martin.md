Now that we have passed “peak orchestrator” and as Kubernetes eats the world, we are left wondering: how secure is Kubernetes? Can we really run Google-style multi tenanted infrastructure safely? And how can we be sure what we configured yesterday will be in place tomorrow?

In this talk we discuss:

* the Kubernetes security landscape
* risks, security models, and configuration best-practices
* how to configure users and applications with least-privilege
* how to isolate and segregate workloads and networks
* hard and soft multi-tenancy
* Continuous Security approaches to Kubernetes
