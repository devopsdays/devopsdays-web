You donâ€™t have to be a manager or a boss to be a leader. Effective leadership means celebrating the strengths of individuals and empowering them with the tools to implement innovative new ideas. Time spent resolving conflicts in the workplace decreases productivity and stifles creativity. This workshop offers suggestions for improving your results at work by increasing interpersonal skills, building a personal brand, understanding your optimal work environment, and how to present professional projects.
