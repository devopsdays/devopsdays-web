In a fast moving DevOps world it is all about enabling teams to move faster. Autonomy is key to get to a higher pace of innovation. Butâ€¦ Does autonomy mean that everybody can do everything? Even on production? Definitely not, but how do you balance between autonomy and restictions. When it comes to security and permissions this is a hard topic. How do you (or the security officer) keep track if everything is compliant? How can you restrict permissions without killing the speed and autonomy of your development teams?

Like with everything else in our industry, code is the answer. In this session Geert and Rene will tell you about their ideas of implementing Security as Code. How thinking about security in a different way can avoid manual security settings and avoids configuration drift in the future. They will show you the open source library they are creating to achieve this goal and talk about how they implemented these principles at several companies.
