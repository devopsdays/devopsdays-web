A silly ignite to continue the devopsdays Amsterdam tradition of bringing ̶d̶e̶v̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶p̶s̶ Dutch and Non-dutch together.

Last year, I introduced the non-dutch members of the audience to the words, leuk, lekker and—most importantly—gezellig. This year, I hope to extend the DevOps tradition of bringing d̶e̶v̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶o̶p̶s̶ Dutch and Non-dutch together by discussing some quirky bits of Dutch culture and making tenuous connections to DevOps practices and lessons.

I hope to cover such topics as: observability & why the Dutch don’t like curtains; and how FEBO is the result of broken DevOps.
