“twee halen een betalen”, how to halve server cost doubling throughput of your Node.js application. From understanding Node.js internals to mastering the art of performance optimization learning the techniques that we daily use to help Fortune100 companies to stay up-and-running.

We’ve been discovering how to write performant JavaScript in Node.js since the beginning. Before we knew how it was it done it all seemed so magical. But as we became better at understanding fast-scrolling text littered with hex addresses we began a journey to solidify our approach and share it with others. Our primary strategy? Build tools that make optimizing Node easier, then formalize a workflow process around those tools. The workshop is extremely interactive. We make sure that each participant solves several performance issues in a given HTTP application. Our methods and tools include 0x for flamegraph generation, autocannon for HTTP/1.1 benchmarking, v8 trace analysis, and bytecode interpretation all within a structured analysis workflow.
