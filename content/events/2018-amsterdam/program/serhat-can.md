I’m planning to share our experience of using AWS Lambda with Java on production. The focus will be on the challenges such as cold-starts, monitoring, concurrency execution limits, and why we still need DevOps in Serverless applications. We are a bit tired than we started but we are still excited about Serverless… This will be a short version of OpsGenie’s journey to Serverless.
