I am Aernout van den Burg, age 41, I live in Den Haag, together with my wife, two daughters, a dog and two cats. I work in IT for over a decade now, since 2015 as a Scrum Master. Last year, I was triggered by Martijn van Asseldonks blog on psychological safety. Together we developed a workshop format that can help team members to open up on this. I facilitated the SAFE-O-METER several times and was really impressed on how open people can speak about not feeling safe.
