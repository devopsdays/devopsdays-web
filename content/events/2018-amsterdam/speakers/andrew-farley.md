Farley’s a Senior DevOps Engineer, long before the term DevOps had a label. He likes to get his hands dirty, and has seen a wide range of environments and learned a fair bit of skills along the way. He’s seen the digital equivalent of empires rise and fall, and been in the trenches supporting some of them, and trying to carve out a hole of his own.

He’s an author, active user and contributor to a variety of projects on Github. He loves to share what he makes, and learn from what others make.
