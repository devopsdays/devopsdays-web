Andy Repton is a Mission Critical Engineer at Schuberg Philis. A keen learner, he uses innovative open source technologies to design solutions to all sorts of challenges, ranging from running genomics pipelines to microservices web portals to financial development environments. When he’s not working or speaking at events, you’ll usually find Andy in the streets of a far off country with a bag on his back, taking pictures and eating strange foods.
