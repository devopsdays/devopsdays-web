I’ve always been fascinated by the confusion between engineers, and non- engineers. Even though they can work at the same company, it seems like they are speaking completely different languages sometimes. I’ve found with enough patience and proper abstraction, I can explain just about any deep technical concept to someone who does not work with computers for a living. As a hobby I love organising things and making abstract concepts tangible. In the past I’ve organised everything from meetups all the way to large festivals.
