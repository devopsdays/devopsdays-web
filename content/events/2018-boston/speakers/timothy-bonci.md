* Jack-of-all-trades, which is different from full-stack.
* Degree in biotech, past life in broadband engineering (and wine, cheese, A/V, suitsâ€¦) I was a working adult for 10 years before IT.
* Only been working with computers professionally for 6 years: 4 in Problem and Incident Management, 2 in Sustaining Engineering.
* I dislike team boundaries and work across a wide range of operational areas.
* Passionate about staffing, problem solving, and having a wide view.
* IT adrenaline junkie.
* I spend 12 hours a week commuting so I can live in the country with my alpacas and chickens.
