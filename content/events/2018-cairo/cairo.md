Cairo (al-Qāhirah) is the capital of Egypt, located near the [Nile Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Delta "Nile Delta").  The city's metropolitan area is one of the largest in Africa, the Middle East and the Arab world, and the 15th-largest in the world.  It is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its geographical area.

DevOpsDays Cairo 2018 is the first to happen in Egypt and the Arab World.  It brings practitioners, management and leadership, and government together to discuss the culture and tools to make better organizations and products.

We expect more than 350 people to attend and we will be holding the event on 17 September 2018 at Grand Nile Tower Hotel, Cairo, Egypt.
The format of DevOpsDays Cairo includes a track of 30 minute talks and 5 minute Ignite talks.  

We spend the rest of the afternoon in Open Spaces, which are considered a key activity of the event.
