You heard about this Kubernetes thing. You saw that all major cloud providers have it in their offering. You noticed that multiple vendors sell a boxed version with support. From time to time you were running into news that some company had just migrated into it. And recently your good friend got it from github and is right now trying to deploy it. You wanted to take a closer look last month but the deadlines and projects looming over you didnâ€™t allow you to learn the details. Does it sound like you?

It it does then this is a talk for you! During this talk I will explain the basics of Kubernetes - production-ready, open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. I will discuss what are the main concepts, when to use it and how to build modern applications with it.
