Marcin Wielgus is a Senior Software Engineer at Google. Marcin joined the internet search giant in 2010 and since then he has been working on various projects, ranging from Android applications to recommendation engines. More than 3 years ago he moved to a relatively small infrastructure effort called Kubernetes, which, to his big surprise, has grown to be one of the biggest open source projects and de-facto standard for running containerized applications. Currently he is a Tech Lead of the Kubernetes Autoscaling team.
