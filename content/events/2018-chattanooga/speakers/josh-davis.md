I have personally worked for 3 different IT services company and 1 software company, and have seen firsthand when companies want to make use of customer and business data, but can’t because of their past technology decisions. I now have a great resource who is helping me raise awareness about this and other issues through our podcast - IT Coach for Business Leaders. Along with Aaron Swann, Virtual CIO (vCIO) at InfoSystems, I am helping to educate non-IT business leaders and IT professionals and raise the awareness of crucial technology topics that should be top of mind.
