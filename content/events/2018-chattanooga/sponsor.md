<h3 style="color:blue;">Thanks for your support! We are sold out of diamond and platinum sonsporships. Only gold, silver, and bronze sponsorships still are available.</h3>

<hr>
devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
At devopsdays Chattanooga <strong>Gold sponsors get a full table</strong> where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. These tables will be located in a prime location inside the venue, right along with snacks and beverages on the way into the main auditorium.
<p>
We're offering some unique opportunities for Silver sponsors this year, like sponsoring our break out rooms, but <strong>Silver sponsors will not have any dedicated table space</strong> this year.
<p>
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
<p>

<p>Gold, Silver, &amp; Bronze sponsorships can be immediately purchased using the buttons at the bottom of this page.
