In this exciting new adaptation of P.D. Eastman’s classic children’s book, “Are You My Mother?”, a junior engineer wades through the numerous definitions of devops as they try to figure out what their “devops” is. What will they learn on their journey? How snarky will the narrator get?

When a person starts learning about devops, it can be hard to know which of the many definitions they’ll see or hear is the correct one. Are there many correct definitions? Are some more correct than others? It can be hard to know without someone guiding you. Even then, who’s to say they’re right?

Join us on the heartwarming adventure of a ~bird~ junior engineer, who after ~hatching from an egg~ starting their first job must figure out just what devops is. The engineer will approach many ~animals~ definitions of devops, trying to find ~their mother~ what they believe to be devops. This journey, which is clearly not a blatant ripoff of a beloved children’s story, will leave us laughing and crying. Who knows, maybe we’ll even learn something along the way?
