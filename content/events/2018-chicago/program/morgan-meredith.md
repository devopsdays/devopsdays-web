I started Jellyvision's release management program in 2016 and helped teams go from 50 releases in 2016 to 300 in 2017, while reducing the rollback rate from 8% to 4%. We went from multi-day, morale-plummeting deploys to checklist-driven deploys with lots of structure, which paved the way for CICD in a few ways, but also held that progress back. 

I'll talk through the practical steps we took to continue evolving to CICD while making the best of the structure that Release Management provides.
