        <p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Mike Rother has been studying Toyota Production Systems (TPS) for almost three decades.  In 2009, in his book Toyota Kata, he explained how Toyota was able to achieve dominating success in the market for over 40 years using what he calls "meta-skills".  Put simply, he explained how Toyota acted like scientists in every facet of their business. Over the past few years, there have been numerous examples of how the ideas patterns and practices of Toyota Kata have been successfully used in Devops modern IT Transformations.  Leap to 2018 where there are now interesting conversations happening around Devops and Security.  This discussion has been coined as DevSecOps.  In this presentation, we are going to tie together the amazing Devops Kata work with some of the new ideas emerging with the DevSecOps discussions. </p>
