**Although QAs and DevOps can be seen as two different roles, the truth is that they have more things in common than we think.**

When we are creating the structure of our test suites, we need to take into account some practices and tools DevOps normally use in their daily work. From integrating the test automation with the CI tool to catching bugs as soon as possible to the use of containers to speed up test executions.

In this talk, we are going to discover different tips and tricks that make QAs and DevOps good friends.
