##### TALK ABSTRACT

Everyone loves Serverless, but what if I told you that you that’s there’s a tool out there that can take it to the next level? AWS Step Functions combine logic and Lambdas into complex state machines that take automation to the next level. In this talk we will cover the basics of Step Functions, a Lambda design pattern that emphasizes code re-use, and some examples of what you can do with Step Functions. The code will be provided ahead of the conference and attendees are encouraged to follow along during the technical portion of the presentation.
