Seems like all you hear about these days are Single Page Applications. Angular, React, Vue, Ember are transforming the way we think about the frontend. But what about securing these applications? This often tends to take a back seat to speed, animations and other cool features of these frameworks. Between cookies, tokens, keeping users authenticated, and handling resource access, securing these apps can be tricky - you may even feel like you need a second page (gasp!) for your authentication setup! But we have the technology to create truly secure single-page applications. In this talk, we’ll walk through securing a Vue application, but our approach will apply to nearly any single-page application framework.
