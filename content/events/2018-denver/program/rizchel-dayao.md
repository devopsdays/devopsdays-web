There are many choices when looking for the right solution to manage and deploy our applications. We, as developers, are often overwhelmed with all of the options to choose from. One of our many options is Kubernetes. I’ve recently dived into deploying and managing an application on Kubernetes. In this talk, I will take you through my journey and explain the advantages and disadvantages of Kubernetes.

* What is Docker
* What is Kubernetes
* Dockering an application
* Using Kubernetes to deploy a containerized application on IBM Cloud
* Pros and cons of Kubernetes
* Common pitfalls

By the end of this talk, you will have the resources and tools to determine if this is the right solution for you and how you can get your application deployed!
