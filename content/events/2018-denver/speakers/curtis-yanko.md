Curtis Yanko is a Global Director of Technology for Channels and Alliances at Sonatype and a DevOps coach/evangelist. Prior to coming to Sonatype Curtis started the DevOps Center of Enablement at a Fortune 100 insurance company and chaired a Open Source Governance Committee. When he isn’t working with customers and partners on how to build security and governance into modern CI/CD pipelines he can be found raising service dogs or out playing ultimate frisbee during his lunch hour. Curtis is currently working on building strategic technical partnerships to help solve for the rugged devops tool chain.

Public speaking engagements include AgileCT on Applying XP Practices In Agile Development, Gartner Security Summit on Security At The Speed Of Development, DevNation on How DevOps Protects Brand, and IBM Innovate on How Deployment Automation Drives Cultural Change. IBM Interconnect on Creating DevSecOps teams that aren’t Evil. Jenkins User Conference on Making Strides Towards Enterprise Scale DevOps with Jenkins in your Toolchain. I’ve given this talk as a lightning talk at DevOpsDays Hartford.
