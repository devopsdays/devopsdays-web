Richard Dawkins described memes as a being a form of cultural propagation, which is a way for people to transmit social memories and cultural ideas to each other. Not unlike the way that DNA and life will spread from location to location, a meme idea will also travel from mind to mind.

Changing the mindset of any organization to a more humane approach to ops - including awareness of alert fatigue, burnout risk, and proactive vs. reactive approaches - can seem impossible.

In this talk, I will discuss how the very DNA of an organization can evolve through the use of actionable communications from all levels - management, strategy, and practitioners. The "virus" of humane ops will infect your organization, providing a more sustainable approach to on-call, incident resolution, post-mortems, and more. There also will be copious references to the Neal Stephenson classic novel, Snow Crash.

After this talk, you will have ideas of practical approaches to effect change in your organization, regardless of your level of influence. While not every group will use the same "viruses", you will take away a good understanding of where to get started as Patient Zero.
