My career has spanned two decades, working in technology on both agency and product sides. I've worked as an analyst, strategist, and marketer. As a team member at ThoughtWorks, I get to help people learn more about continuous delivery, understand their needs, and work with our product teams to address those needs. On a personal note, I ride motorcycles, I race motorcycles, I talk about motorcycles, I wear lots of t-shirts that have motorcycles on them. I'm also a triathlete.
