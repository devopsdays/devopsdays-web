Knowing how to code is one thing, but showing someone else how to do it is another. Ever feel like you want to share your knowledge, but don't know how to communicate it efficiently? Or want to challenge yourself to speak in front of an audience, but don't feel confident enough?

Come along to learn how to give a compelling technical talk, or see me try explaining it all in 5 minutes. This technique is suitable for everyone regardless of who you are and what level of experience you have, and focuses on conference talks but can also be applied at meetings or presentations.
