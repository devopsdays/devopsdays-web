Title = "At Ecosia.org, Site Reliability That Plants Trees"

Ecosia.org is the search engine that uses its ad revenue to plant trees. Search engine users have come to expect perfect reliability, which is challenging for a small engineering team of ten developers, with only two focusing on infrastructure. In order for the team to practice Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), including a balance between projects and toil, the developers designed a a self-service production platform based on Kubernetes which is simple to maintain, easy to extend, and provides a developer toolkit with sane defaults. This talk will highlight how Ecosia leverages this platform in addition to open-source software like Bazel, Jsonnet, and Prometheus, to provide simple tooling, user-focused monitoring, and a software ownership culture. This infrastructure effort helps the Ecosia developers measure and achieve their primary metric - trees planted per second.
