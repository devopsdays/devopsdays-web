You have found a secret room! You gain 26xp.

Other people: sometimes difficult to work with, impossible to predict. How can you get the right people involved in your technical project, keep them engaged, and prevent delays? Why do some people thrive despite poor documentation and how can you encourage them to document everything anyway?
