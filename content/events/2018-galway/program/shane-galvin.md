Microservices and Kubernetes are transforming the way we approach application development and deployment. 
 
However, automated testing of these types of services is challenging and often requires a mindset shift from traditional approaches to testing of monolithic based applications.
 
In this talk I will discuss the types of tests that make good candidates for automation in your pipeline, how much of each type of test you need, what tools can help, how to test your services in isolation, and how to avoid end-to-end integration hell.
