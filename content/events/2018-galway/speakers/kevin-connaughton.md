Kevin Connaughton, Cisco Galway. Lots of roles in lots of large multinationals in lots of countries over a 20+ career, but with a common thread of Technical Customer Care running through all. 8+ years at Cisco Galway, moving from a traditional QA role to what I would describe as an SRE role. Work areas of interest are methodologies and tools to enhance internal and external Customer experience. Out of the office I enjoy running : )
