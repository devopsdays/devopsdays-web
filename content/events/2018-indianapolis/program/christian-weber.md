Organizations, big and small, are tasked with hiring remote developers,
but routinely struggle with retention and productivity. Let’s talk about
how you can improve the people experience, to empower and supercharge
productivity in your internal software development community!

Software Development is increasingly becoming a distributed process:
Developers are now using tools that allow for distributed style
development, and organizations are evolving to allow developers to work
where they feel most productive. Many organizations, however, do not
have a process or plan in place to set-up Developers for success.
Employees can feel isolated from their team, suffer from impostor
syndrome, and quickly lose motivation when these issues compound on
themselves.

GitHub is a majority remote workforce that has succeeded in helping our
employees feel like a larger part of the organization, while being
geo-distributed via the entire planet. In this talk, we’ll talk about
how we do this internally at GitHub, and the experience of working with
other distributed organizations through the use of "Social Capital" –
that is, giving developers a tangible sense of belonging and ownership
that helps curtail isolation and builds retention within your team.
