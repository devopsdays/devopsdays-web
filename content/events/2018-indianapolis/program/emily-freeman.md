So the dumpster is on fire. Again. The site’s down. Your boss’s face is
an ever-deepening purple. And you begin debating whether you should join
the #incident channel or call an ambulance to deal with his impending
stroke.

Fires are never going to stop. We’re human. We miss bugs. Or we fat
finger a command — deleting dozens of servers and bringing down S3 in
US-EAST-1 for hours — effectively halting the internet. These things
happen. **But we can fundamentally change the way we approach fires. And
that requires adopting the techniques of industries much older than
ours.**

This talk will focus on how firefighters approach a fire — before,
during and after an incident — and how we can apply those strategies to
our own (admittedly much less dangerous) fires.
