DevOps is one of the hottest buzzwords in the technology industry today,
but what is it? In this presentation I will attempt to explain what
DevOps is and what the buzz is all about. Specifically, I will explain:
what DevOps is and what it means to businesses; why DevOps is needed and
why it’s so popular (i.e. why so many companies are adopting its
methodologies); and I will explain how DevOps is "done." I will go over
the tooling used by DevOps practitioners, including the necessary tech
skills needed by today’s Systems Admins/Engineers.
