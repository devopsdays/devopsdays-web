Over the last year, I’ve dedicated much of my energy to building out the
SRE efforts at VictorOps.

During that time, I documented the entire process and have uncovered a
rich set of ideas and questions that should help any team and company
begin their own journey towards improved Site Reliability

Without prescribing a specific path towards SRE, I can share the path
that we took at VictorOps.. including the questions we had, the
conversations that came from them, the result of our efforts, and what
remains ahead of us as we continuous improve our SRE efforts.

I’ll outline a simple formula that nearly every team and organization
can apply to begin their own journey.
