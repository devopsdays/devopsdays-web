Title = "Immutable Infrastructure Without the Cloud"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["martez-reed"]

Immutable infrastructure is a practice most commonly associated with
public cloud workloads to eliminate the need to manage servers as pets.
This talk walks through creating immutable on-prem workloads to provide
the same benefits as well as greatly simplify the migration of workloads
to the cloud.

The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how
immutable infrastructure coupled with a CI/CD process can reduce
template sprawl, simplify security patching and provide an audit trail
for templates.

* What is Immutable infrastructure?
* Common traditional use cases
* More advanced use cases such as database and file servers
* What is CI/CD?
* Building out a CI/CD pipeline for template management
* Provision and reprovision infrastructure with immutable images
* Track template usage and version changes

At the conclusion of the session attendees should walk away with a
roadmap of how to transition to a robust template pipeline creation
process that enables them to swap out VMs seamlessly at the push of a
button.
