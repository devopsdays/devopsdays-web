Everyone has an opinion about DevOps. The problem is, most people’s
opinions are wrong. In this Ignite, I’ll spin through some of the more
popular misconceptions about DevOps of the last year or so, and clarify
them as only I know how.

Will Kubernetes save your soul? Are enterprises too stodgy for DevOps?
Is immutable infrastructure even a thing? Can you devops without kitten
gif’s? I’ll bust myths and take down thought-leaders with my tongue
planted firmly in cheek.
