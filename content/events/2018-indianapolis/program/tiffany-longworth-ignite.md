1. As long as you're actually accomplishing stuff, people just plain like working with fun folks ([this is the easy one](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/80/803707bd77addc484b42dd0ac5a87c9a0bfa8251b631440ded468689d354c0e4.jpg))

2. [Embedding fun links](https://www.askideas.com/media/40/Dude-You-Gotta-Protect-Me-Funny-Tiger-Meme-Image.jpg) incentivizes readers to read everything (or form-filler-out-ers to fill out your survey)

3. Saying "Please" and "Thank you" with [cute animals](http://gruntle.me/images/cute-kitten2-picture.jpg) gets you better support service

4. [Blowing bubbles](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b9/f0/a5/b9f0a5adbdd1b8c9db9ed662f9d3064d.jpg) engages your parasympathetic nervous system (the anti-fight-or-flight response)!
