Unfortunately, rolling out changes for humans is not as easy as merging
a pull request. How many times have you seen a new project management
tool get rolled out, sometimes with much fanfare and polish, and just
not get adopted? Have you ever seen your company announce a new business
unit which led to a minor revolt? How scary is the word
"reorganization"? If you have ideas on how your group’s processes could
be better, want to launch a new tool that will work better as your
company grows, or have to adjust the way you do things to meet new
regulations, learning the basics of change management will help you to
get your plans going, launch them effectively, and ensure they stick
around.

I’ve helped implement several tools, projects, and process changes over
the years. In this talk, I’ll walk you through the basics of
organizational change management with specific examples about

* Why it's so hard (Newton’s first law of motion; nobody likes
  surprises)
* Points to consider while implementing (Am I sure I’ve identified all
  of the stakeholders? What do I do if I can’t satisfy all of their
wants?)
* Tactics to increase adoption (If you haven’t created evangelists,
  you’re probably creating enemies)
* Keeping the change alive once launched (Can I keep showing
  improvements? Do I have materials that help newcomers?)
* Pitfalls to avoid (Do you really have executive buy-in?)
