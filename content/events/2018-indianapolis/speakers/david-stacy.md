David Stacy is an AWS Professional Services Consultant who is on the
bleeding edge of defining what DevSecOps means in large enterprises.
David has worked for AWS for three years, and as an heavily automated
SysAdmin in the software industry for 20 years. Dave uses osx, vi,
two-space indentation, and grumbles a lot about sysvinit going away.
