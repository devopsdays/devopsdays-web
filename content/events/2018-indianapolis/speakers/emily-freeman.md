After many years of ghostwriting, Emily Freeman made the bold (insane?!)
choice to switch careers into software engineering. Emily is the curator
of JavaScript January â€” a collection of JavaScript articles which
attracts 32,000 visitors in the month of January. A former competitive
powerlifter, she works as a developer advocate for Kickbox and lives in
Denver, Colorado.
