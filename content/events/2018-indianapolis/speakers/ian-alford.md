Ian Alford has been working in the Information Technology field since

as a temporary summer employee. He later joined the SBCSC as full-time
building support for two of the four high schools in South Bend, IN.
During this time, he brought the first VMWare ESXi hosts into the SBCSC

Community School Corporation, Ian completed both his Bachelors of Arts

Indiana University South Bend.

In November 2014, Ian joined the Saint Joseph County Government as the
