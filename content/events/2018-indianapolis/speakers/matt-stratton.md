Matt Stratton is a DevOps Evangelist at PagerDuty, where he helps dev
and ops teams advance the practice of their craft and become more
operationally mature. He collaborates with PagerDuty customers and
industry thought leaders in the broader devops community, and his
license plate actually says “DevOps”.

Matt has over 20 years experience in IT operations, ranging from large
financial institutions such as JPMorganChase and internet firms,
including Apartments.com. He has given presentations at ITSM focused
events, ChefConf, DevOpsDays, Interop, PINK, and various local groups
within the Chicagoland area. He is the founder and co-host of the
popular [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/) podcast.

He lives in the Chicagoland area with his wife Andrea, their cat Fancy,
and his three kids, Henry, Joey, and Sophia. He also has an unhealthy
obsession with Doctor Who, Firefly, and Game of Thrones. And whiskey.
