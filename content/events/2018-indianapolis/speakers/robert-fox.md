Rob Fox has presented professionally in the past, but the topic of
DevOps is of particular interest to Rob in his role as the manager of a
Development group. Rob is leading a team within Hesburgh Libraries to
identify what DevOps specifically means to the Libraries, and how we can
leverage the DevOps culture to deliver value.
