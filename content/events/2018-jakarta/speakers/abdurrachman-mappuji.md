I wake and work every single morning to empower developers to do great things. I work as Software Development Engineer in Test (formal title), but there I empower developer to move faster by improving their development cycle and build tools. In my free time I contribute to open source project called Open Learning Exchange where it is actually non profit organization where resonates with my biggest driver where I imagine every people in the world think that education is not a constraint for them to be succeed in life. Education is mainstream and accessible for all. In this project we develop a learning system called planet where we have planet-like community where we have, community, earth, and planet. My biggest contribution is building the development workflow and build automation, operating system distro development and deployment with docker. In this DevOps Day I will talk about my experience working voluntary in nonprofit organization.
