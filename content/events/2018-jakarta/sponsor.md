We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please <a href="mailto:organizers-jakarta-2018@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor DevOpsDays Jakarta 2018">drop us an email</a> or [download the prospectus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_7L8gNjinErM5mG3gO8qEapNqb1yipBE) right away.

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute the attendee contact lists.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

## Why Sponsor Us?

The DevOpsDays event mandate is to bring the highest quality speakers, experts, and the curious together. This is the first edition of DevOpsDays in Jakarta and the fourth edition in Southeast Asia.

Jakarta is not only one of the fastest growing startup hubs in the world but is also a trusted healthcare, telecom, and financial services nexus in Asia with strong investment in technology from the Government. We aim to attract representation from large enterprises and the startup community alike.

By sponsoring DevOpsDays, you will be exposing your organization’s brand and services to Indonesia and Southeast Asia’s top talent in this rapidly growing space.

Sponsoring DevOpsDays Jakarta connects your company to some of the greatest technical and business minds in the industry who are influencing decisions in security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and organisational change.
