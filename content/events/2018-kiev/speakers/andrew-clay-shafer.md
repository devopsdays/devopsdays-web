Andrew Clay Shafer was devopsing before devops was a word.

He is often referenced as a foundational voice in the devops movement with a lot of experience and perspective contributing to open source, operating services and building communities.

DevOps has been very good to Andrew and he has tried to return the favor. He spends most days trying to help Pivotal customers develop and operate software.
