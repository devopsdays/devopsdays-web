We all love DevOps talks about automated deployments. However, for every other type of operations work, ticket-driven request queues have quietly become the default way of working. Need something done? Open a ticket. Someone needs you to do something? A ticket shows up in your queue. 

But what if we made a mistake letting ticket queues take over operations? What if these ticket queues are actually the source of much of the dysfunction, bottlenecks, and capacity issues that have traditionally plagued our organizations? This talk is going to make that case and discuss our alternatives.
