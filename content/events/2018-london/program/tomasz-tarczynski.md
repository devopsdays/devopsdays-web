We hear a lot about building cloud native applications and platforms. But what does it really mean?
Is it just about using a public cloud? Or is it relevant when you want to benefit from microservices architecture?
I will try to dig into what are the reasons why Cloud Native is worth investing our time. And also what are the patterns of it and how can we benefit from them.
As it’s only a 5-minute ignite talk, I’ll try to find what is the essence of this approach to application delivery.
