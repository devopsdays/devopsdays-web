[Mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is a next gen config management engine that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.
This presentation will have a large number of demos of the language.
We will present a number of traditional use cases that were historically quite difficult to setup and deploy, but which can now be expressed as simple snippets of code.
Examples will include service discovery, auto-scaling, provisioning, state-machines, scheduling and more!
Finally we’ll talk about some of the future designs we’re planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
