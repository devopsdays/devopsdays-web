On-call stress & pager fatigue have led to burnout & mental health issues in the DevOps community. If we truly are a community, then we need to know how to keep ourselves healthy and, just as important, how to help others in crisis.

With the constant demand to build systems rapidly with more resiliency and less budget, compounded with on-call support duties and a seemingly endless stream of alerts, it’s no wonder that burnout has become a serious problem within the DevOps community.

But we are also a DevOps community, which means we need to take care of each other. I’ll provide an easy to remember framework attendees can implement to identify, help and support others experiencing burnout and mental health issues.
