Kubernetes is designed to solve a specific problem: container scheduling. Many organizations want Kubernetes to replace painful infrastructure, but don't yet need container management. We'll cover the culture and tech changes to transform existing problems into the problems Kubernetes solves.

Almost every organization has a painful time managing their infrastructure, especially when legacy and manual systems are involved. Cloud platforms (and Kubernetes in particular) are very trendy solutions for infrastructure pain. However, Kubernetes solves specific problems around container scheduling and container management. In order to solve their problems with Kubernetes, organizations must transform their existing problems to container scheduling and management problems. Doing this entails more than just adding containers - it requires decoupled components, distinct team roles, atomic deployments, and many other changes to technology and teamwork.

Vallery will talk about:
* Successes and failures with Kubernetes adoption at Checkfront.
* Her experience with how to practically bring about cultural and technical changes.
* How to work towards autonomous development teams.
* How to transform infrastructure problems into problems with known solutions, specifically container scheduling.
