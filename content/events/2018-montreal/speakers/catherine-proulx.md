I am a researcher at the National Research Council Canada (CNRC-NRC), where I study the convergence of virtual reality with health technologies. I have spent my entire career split between the worlds of medical devices and gaming, and I've worn multiple hats including that of researcher, developer, SDET and test lead. My superpower is taking good ideas that sort of work, and making them work in real life - hopefully not killing anyone in the process.
