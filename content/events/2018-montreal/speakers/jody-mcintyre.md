Jody McIntyre is the Director of DevOps and Infrastructure at Plotly, a data visualization startup. He has over 10 years of bash scripting experience but until being introduced to Bats and Shellcheck about 2 years ago generally dreaded working on any script over 20 lines long. He is now a huge advocate of these tools and is actively introducing them throughout Plotly's codebase.
