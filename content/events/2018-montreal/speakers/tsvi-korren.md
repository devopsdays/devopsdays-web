I am a 20-year security professional, and worked with many organizations (companies and public) to secure application deployments. My interests are organizational. I believe that security can improve using better practices and communications, with tools and software as implementations of good security habits.
Unlike many of my colleagues, I saw containers as a security opportunity, and joined Aqua to prove it. Over the past two years, I have been talking and presenting to hundreds of developers, operations and security people, with the goal to build a bridge and establish collaboration.
