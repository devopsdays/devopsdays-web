A look at the last 10 years of Devops.  What have we learned in the
Devops movement from around 2007.  Early Cfengine saturation based
on principles of convergence, desired state and idempotency. Puppet
becomes mainstream in 2008-2010 replacing a lot of Cfegnine for
early web-scale IaaS.  Chef in 2009 driving reusable infrastructure
with recipes and cookbooks.  Continuous Delivery becomes mainstream
around 2010.  Containers and immutable delivery models 2015-2016.
Deming and Goldratt influence on Devops via Gene Kim.  Formalization
of Lean principles VSM via Rother's "Learning to See" as well as
Kanban for Software from DJ Anderson.  Mike Rother's Kata influence
and Dr Spear further Lean influences on practices of Devops. Mike
Nygard's "Release It" circuit breaker patterns on mainstream and
actually becoming state of the art in Google's new Envoy/ITSIO
design.  2010 Dr. Cook's "Why Complex Systems Fail" reference in
John Allspaw's Web Operations book.  Dr. Sidney Dekker's Drift into
Failure as input to the Netflix design.    All the way up to Dr.
Cook, Dr. Woods and John Allspaw's recent 2017 Stella Report.  Finish
up with a look at where we are today and a quick glimpse at some
potentially interesting new influencers (Cynefin and Simon Wardley's
Mapping).
