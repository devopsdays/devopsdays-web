When a datacenter goes offline, a server gets overloaded, or a binary hits a crashing bug, we usually have a contingency plan. We reduce damage, redirect traffic, page someone, drop low-priority requests, document procedures. But why do many failures still come as a surprise? In this talk, we look at some real life analogs to the contingency plans we use in tech. Sprinkler systems. Life boats. Earthquake warning alarms. Load shedding. Doors that say “This is not an exit”. What can we learn from the real world about expecting failure and designing for it?
