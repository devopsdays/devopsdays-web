Title = "Stealing the Best Ideas from DevOps: Applying DevOps outside of SDLC"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["thomas-a-limoncelli"]
+++

DevOps talks tend to emphasize SLDC and CI/CD situations. In this talk I teach 5 of the most important DevOps principles (Small Batches, MVP, and The Three Ways of DevOps) by applying those principles outside of the usual web application environment. Case studies improving a new-hire onboarding process, improving a website failover process, deploying a monitoring system, building a PXE-install system, and writing a book. By the end of this talk you'll have a better understanding of the principles of DevOps in a way that helps you apply them at home and at work.
