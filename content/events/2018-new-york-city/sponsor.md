devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver, and Bronze, sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.

<li><b>Lanyard Sponsorship:</b>  Everyone at the event will be wearing a lanyard and this represents a great opportunity to get your name in front of all attendees.  The lanyard will be printed with your branding on it.  There is only a single sponsorship available and it is $2,500.  </li>
<li><b>Thursday Evening Social Sponsorship:</b>  Your chance to plan and host the social event on Thursday for all attendees of the DevOpsDays event.  This will be the official Thursday night networking / after-hours event and therefore will appear as such on all marketing materials.  While we understand such events may include alcohol, it would be preferable for the focus to be on the socializing aspect.  We are open to discussing ideas on how this might be achieved.  </li>
</ul>
