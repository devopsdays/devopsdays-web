In 2016, companies spent over $25 billion on public cloud services.   And almost a quarter of that spend was wasted on idle or unnecessary resources.  That's upwards of $6 billion (with a 'B') in money washed down the drain.  And chances are, you are on of the people who could trim the overhead on your cloud spend.  There are numerous studies and research done to identify the areas for improvement, but if you boil it down to the basics, you'll find that there may be a single primary reason for all the cloud overhead.  And that's what I'll cover in this talk.
