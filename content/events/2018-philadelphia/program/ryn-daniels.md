Devops originally started as a way of enabling both developers and operations engineers to work better together, but over the years since its inception it has become much more than that. The principles of devops can be beneficial to everyone involved in creating software solutions, not just dev and ops teams. This talk will discuss practical ideas for how the pillars of effective devops can be used throughout entire organizations, the benefits of sharing operational effectiveness beyond the ops team, and how to use devops principles to develop and maintain a functional culture within your organizations.
