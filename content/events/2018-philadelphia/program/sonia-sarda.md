Getting into a feedback loop with local startups is one of the most low cost and highest return ways a company can innovate. While focusing on exploiting their market through day to day opportunities, companies can also partner with early stage startups and explore how newer technologies can increase or better serve their customer base, and if successful, come up with plans to bring the technology in house. Startups are generally happy with this arrangement as they have the opportunity to test their products with potential clientele and get feedback from the best possible source: the customer.
