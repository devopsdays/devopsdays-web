As a Project Management Expert, Software Quality Professional, IT Service Management Expert, Business Instructor, Agile Expert and SDLC Coach:

Because of Alan’s breadth of experience and 4 decades of depth, he brings a pragmatic consulting approach to each event. He encourages participants to raise questions and issues from their own experience, listens carefully and strives to make the material relevant to their situations. When appropriate, he freely admits, "You're right; this won't work for you." Participants regularly cite Mr. Koch's knowledge and patience as prime reasons why they get so much out of his events and have fun doing it. 

Alan was an advocate for integrating development and operations teams long before the term DevOps was coined.  He wrote articles and spoke at conferences on the opportunities for synergy, and he worked with his consulting clients to establish what is now known as a DevOps culture, and what we now call a continuous deployment pipeline.  Alan’s depth of experience in both Dev and Ops has made him a key contributor to ASPE’s DevOps offerings.
