Matty Stratton is a DevOps Evangelist at PagerDuty, where he helps dev and ops teams advance the practice of their craft and become more operationally mature. He collaborates with PagerDuty customers and industry thought leaders in the broader devops community, and back when he drove, his license plate actually said “DevOps”.

Matty has over 20 years experience in IT operations, ranging from large financial institutions such as JPMorganChase and internet firms, including Apartments.com. He has given presentations at ITSM focused events, ChefConf, DevOpsDays, Interop, PINK, and various local groups within the Chicagoland area. He is the founder and co-host of the popular Arrested DevOps podcast.

He lives in San Francisco and has three awesome kids - Henry, Joey, and Sophia. He also has an unhealthy obsession with Doctor Who, Firefly, and Game of Thrones. And whiskey.
