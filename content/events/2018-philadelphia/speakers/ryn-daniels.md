Ryn Daniels is a staff infrastructure operations engineer at Travis CI who got their start in programming with TI-80 calculators back when GeoCities was still cool. These days, they have opinions on things like monitoring, on-call usability, and Effective DevOps.  Before escaping to the world of operations, they spent a few years doing R&D and systems engineering in the corporate world. Ryn lives in Berlin, Germany with a perfectly reasonable number of cats and in their spare time can often be found powerlifting, playing cello, or handcrafting knitted server koozies for the data center.
