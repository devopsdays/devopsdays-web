<h2>Where to Stay</h2>

<p>
We do not have any blocks of rooms reserved, but can recommend many suitable hotels in the Phoenix Downtown area.
</p>

<p>
All are a 15 minute ride from the airport using taxis or ride sharing. Using the light rail is also convenient but takes a little bit longer at about 40 minutes The 3rd st. and Washington Light Rail Station is the closest station coming from the airport. From any downtown hotel it is a quick 5 minute ride (about a mile) to Galvanize.
