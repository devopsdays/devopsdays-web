Nearing the end of a DevOps transformation includes scaling automation and being efficient with time. Continous Integration helps make that happen. We'll use CI to deploy changes for the business at scale and show how to be confident in the process and code.

We'll start with some pre-made code and tests, explain that and then dive into situations on changes that have to happen for the business to deploy a required feature or change. Then we‚ll go into creating effective CI process and match the business situations we talked about earlier with those processes.
