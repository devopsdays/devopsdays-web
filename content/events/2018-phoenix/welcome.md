    <p><strong>Learning</strong></p>

    <p>At DevOpsDays we discuss the culture and tools that can make organizations run better, deliver faster, and improve quality.

    <p>This year we would like to focus on:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Getting Started: Half hour sessions for beginners in a specific domain.</li>
    <li>Advanced: Half hour sessions for experienced and forward looking attendees.</li>
    <li>Case Studies / Fail Stories: Fifteen minute sessions for people of all experience ranges where speakers share technical or cultural anecdotes where they succeeded or failed in a DevOps related domain. Failure is fun. People love to know that other people fail on occasion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>
<p>DevOpsDays Phoenix is excited to announce the following speakers and topic concepts that will be covered at the 2018 conference! </p>

    <p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>

    <p>One of the great parts of DevOpsDays is learning from other attendees.  There will be plenty of time to share success and failure stories with each other, get feedback on your next crazy idea, ask for help solving a real world problem you are facing when you go back to work on Wednesday.</p>
