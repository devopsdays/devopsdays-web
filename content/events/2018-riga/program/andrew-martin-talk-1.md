<p>Now that we have passed “peak orchestrator” and as Kubernetes eats the world, we are left wondering: how secure is Kubernetes? Can we really run Google-style multi tenanted infrastructure safely? And how can we be sure what we configured yesterday will be in place tomorrow? In this talk we discuss: - the Kubernetes security landscape - risks, security models, and configuration best-practices - how to configure users and applications with least-privilege - how to isolate and segregate workloads and networks - hard and soft multi-tenancy - Continuous Security approaches to Kubernetes.</p>
