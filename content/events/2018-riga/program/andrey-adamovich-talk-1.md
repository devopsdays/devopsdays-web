<p>SysAdmins are obsolete, we need more DevOps engineers! Or do we?</p>

<p>In this talk, the author will give several use cases from his personal experience helping organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and automation of software delivery and testing.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Why technology X is not what you need right now</li>
<li>Why ignoring skills that are already present in the team may be a huge risk</li>
<li>Why everything-as-code is an effective approach</li>
<li>Why not investing in team member education may be very destructive</li>
<li>Why not having time is a bad excuse for not automating</li>
<li>Why process improvement effects may not be observable immediately</li>
<li>Why cost of automation sometimes is higher than the time invested in writing the scripts</li>
</ul>
