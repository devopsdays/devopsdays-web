<p>In early 2018 Nassim Nicholas Taleb, one of the foremost thinkers of our time, published a new book: Skin in the game. About hidden asymmetries in daily life. Jan de Vries translates this book towards DevOps, as he did before with Taleb’s book Antifragile. It explains why some concepts work and others don’t. It’s like turning on the light in your DevOps environment. And it helps you to improve your (IT) organisation in the right direction. This talk contains practical tips and tricks that can be applied instantly.</p>
