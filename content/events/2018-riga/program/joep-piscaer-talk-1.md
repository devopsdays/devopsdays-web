<p><em>"I have a strategy to solve the DevOps transitional challenge. It is called reducing inertia that can be seen on daily basis in finances, team behavior and tech stacks. Reducing the friction in these areas is key to successfully move to the DevOps way of work. For me, ‘inertia’ is a good way of making value flow visible and I’ve been using it as the principle underlying my work. This approach can be applied especially successfully in more complex environments, such as enterprises."</em></p>
