<p><em>Our journey to Serverless started a year and a half ago and we have learned a lot. We still are, maybe a bit tired than we started but we still are… This will be a short version of OpsGenie’s journey to Serverless. I’m planning to share our experience of using AWS Lambda with Java on production.</em></p>
