Developer, Father, Board Game Player, that’s the background :)

Honestly, I’m a 30ish years old developer, who at a certain point in my life realized that software development is like Lego Bricks. I’ve always loved to build stuff with this bricks, and building software for me is 90% fun and 10% job.

If you like to code, build plastic brick’s towers and play some video and board games, just come with me on my magical journey through this big project called life.
