## Thank you for sponsoring DevOpsDays Seattle!

As you probably know, DevOpsDays is a volunteer run not-for-profit event. Our
goal is to help people learn about DevOps, and we couldn’t do it without your
support. Thank You!!

### Things you should do right away
#### Book your hotel rooms!
A lot of hotels in Seattle sell out in the spring. It’s a good idea to book any
rooms you’ll need as soon as possible. We don't have an official hotel, but there
are many in the area.

#### Register your attendees.
You’ll receive a registration code to be given to people who will be attending
on behalf of your company. Please don’t wait to have them register! We’d like to
have an accurate count as soon as possible. If you haven’t received your code
please email {{< email_organizers >}}

### Dates and Times
This year’s event is on April 24th and 25th, 2018. A more detailed schedule will
be posted soon.

* Booth set up - 7:00AM April 24th
* Registration opens - 8:00AM April 24th (you'll want to be ready to talk to people
by this time)
* Tear down - approximately 4:00PM on April 25th.

### Who to Send
Of course this is up to you, but most attendees will be practitioners. It’s
important to your success that you send people able to have practitioner level
conversations. If you’re showing off your latest product, be ready to answer
some technical questions. If you’re looking to hire people, have someone there
who works in the type of role you’re hiring for.

### Conference Format

DevOpsDays is a unique blend of presentation style talks and interactive open
discussions. The presentations are being chosen from over 200 submissions. We’re
really excited about the talks we’ll see.

The afternoons are run as open spaces. You can learn more about this format
at https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/. To make the most of your
participation it’s highly recommended that your staff participate in the open
space discussions. This is your best chance to show off how valuable you can
be to the attendees.

### Shipping
The venue does not offer direct shipping / receiving.

There is a FedEx Office location in the Convention Center, across the street from
the Conference Center where we'll be. You can find more information, including
hours and contact information at https://local.fedex.com/wa/seattle/office-5161/.

### A/V Rental<a id="av_rental"></a>

We'll post more information about this soon.

### Lead Collection
We don’t share attendee information with sponsors.

You’re welcome to ask people to share their contact information voluntarily.
It’s very common for sponsors to hold drawings for this purpose and we will have
a time at the end of day 2 to announce winners.

Most attendees will not have business cards, so you’ll want to have a way to
capture this information. Some sponsors will bring slips of paper and a
punchbowl, others will use something like Google Forms on a laptop or tablet.

for everyone. The Code of Conduct will be strictly enforced, please be sure to
