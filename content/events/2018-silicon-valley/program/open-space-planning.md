Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as “open spaces”. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they’d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.

The Law of Mobility — Take responsibility for what you love. In practical terms, the law says that if you’re neither contributing nor getting value where you are, move to somewhere where you can.

From the law flow four principles:

    Whoever comes is the right people
    Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
    Whenever it starts is the right time
    When it’s over, it’s over
Prepare to be surprised
Introduction of the principles and format of Open Spaces. Participants will write 'ideas' on post-its, and then share with the group. Participants will vote on topics, and then topics will be assigned spaces and times.
