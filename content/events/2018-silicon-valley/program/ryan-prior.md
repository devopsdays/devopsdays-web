When we plan our agile sprints and staff our teams, do we leave time to operate safely? We know from rigorous data collection that long work hours contribute to a dramatically increased hazard rate, yet we work in a field that often glorifies and rewards all night server room firefights and epic code-crushing death marches. We might be working too hard to be secure. What if we could save money, improve security, and serve our customers better by working less? This session will cover ways that, as DevOps leaders within our organizations, we can lead change, set the example, and use our skills to build reliable systems that don't get hacked.
