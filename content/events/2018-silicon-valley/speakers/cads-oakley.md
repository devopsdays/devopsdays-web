Cads has been messing around with this DevOps thing for a while now and likes making things just kinda work right. The bits he likes making work right most are cross-functional teams and getting well-monitored code to production quickly. Information-rich visualizations and self-service tools make him breathe funny, but in a good way. Oh, and he likes dogs - sorry.
