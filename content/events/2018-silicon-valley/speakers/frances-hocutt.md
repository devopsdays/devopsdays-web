Frances Hocutt has taken part in the science-to-tech branch of the great STEM reshuffling. In the process, he’s written, spoken, mentored, and co-founded Seattle’s first feminist hackerspace/makerspace. Frances prefers elegance in science and effectiveness in art and is happiest when drawing on as many disciplines as possible. Frances jumped into F/OSS development with work on standards for the MediaWiki web API ecosystem and expanded into work on MediaWiki and associated Wikimedia-ecosystem contributor tools. He currently installs software on other people's computers for Rackspace Managed Security's defensive infrastructure team. Frances currently lives in an unfortunately catless apartment in Oakland, CA.
