Katy lives in Oakland, CA with her husband and two dogs (at least one of whom talks to her about fun, technical stuff). She loves to experiment with code, break stuff, and try to fix it. She is known to yell at APIs and ask "Why?" about nearly everything. Ask her about Ruby, OOP, Go, InfluxDB, Russian Literature, Star Wars, Dragon Age, or candy.
