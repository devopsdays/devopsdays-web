Between customer support, SRE, software, build, systems, and infrastructure engineer, Marissa Knittel has worn a lot of hats over the last 15 years of being a professional nerd-for-hire (but never saw "conference speaker" coming!) She currently works in health tech at Clover Health, where she builds systems and infrastructure for software that helps improve patient outcomes.
