Sanjay is working as a Solution's Architect in NFV and DevOPs space. I worked in various places in network like Branch, Enterprise WAN and Data Center Architectures. I achieved CCIE Emeritus status ( CCIE # 7755) in Routing & Switching. Very much excited about DevOPS, NFV & SDN paradigm shift which is happening in the industry and would love to ride this wave :)
