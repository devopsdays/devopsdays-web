We asked a Fortune 500 software delivery leaders what holds them back. This talk is the analysis of their insights on what bottlenecks they encountered in their DevOps journey. We share discoveries on what helped them to overcome the bottlenecks and how they plan to deliver even faster. Using this we define some unifying themes on what areas provide the greatest return in investments of time and resources.
