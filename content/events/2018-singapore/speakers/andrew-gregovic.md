Andrew is currently a software development manager at PayPal Singapore, working in the Consumer Financial Services team. Most of his technical experience is centred around product development, as well as data/database problems in the context of building scalable, robust and high-performance applications. Also, Andrew loves dabbling in machine learning. By accident rather than intent, Andrew has a colourful workplace background, everything from being a co-founder of a New Zealand loyalty/virtual payments startup to working in large multi-nationals.

After moving around a lot around Asia Pacific, Andrew is finding Singapore to be his favourite place and he hopes he'll move less in the future. Obviously because of the best chicken rice in the world.
