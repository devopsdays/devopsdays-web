David has been managing servers since the mid-90s, and decided to hop the fence and become a developer in 2008. Since then, He has had the privilege of straddling both worlds to build production applications and infrastructure for dozens of companies in both Asia and North America. David joined Pivotal in 2012, where he has been a core contributor to many components of Cloud Foundry, including the Diego scheduler, the CLI, and Windows support. David also had a brief career detour in Washington DC, where he tried to get massive federal agencies to adopt cutting edge agile methodologies and devops (with mixed success).

David is currently the director of Pivotal Labs in Singapore, and can’t stop talking about agile software development, devops, and why Janelle Monae is da bomb. David enjoys his kopi “gao siew dai”, and firmly believes Singapore has some of the best food on the planet.
