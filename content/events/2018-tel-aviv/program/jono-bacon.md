You can't build great software without understanding the architecture of the platform it runs on. Similarly, you can't build great developer and user communities without understanding the psychology and behavioral forces behind in your audience.

In this new keynote from Jono Bacon, leading community strategy consultant and author, he delves into some of the most critical psychological forces commonly present in developer and user communities, unpicks them, and provides pragmatic recommendations for how to harness them in in building communities of users, developers, and ops. This will provide DevOpsDays attendees with a concrete framework in which to not just think about work effectively to collaborate and build communities, but also how to work more effectively with companies, projects, families and beyond.
