My name is Niall Byrne, and I live and work in Toronto where I contract as both a software developer and systems administrator. Although you never work on technical projects in isolation, I have worked relatively independently for most of my career. I have however come to appreciate that being a part of a team is undoubtedly more rewarding in the long run. The transition between the two is a topic that is very dear to me.
