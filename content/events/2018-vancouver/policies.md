## Ticket Policies

### Early bird tickets
Once they’re gone they’re gone.

### Discounts
Unfortunately we are not able to offer discounts for volume purchases.

### What is the refund policy?
There are no refunds for DevopsDays Vancouver 2018.

### What?  Why not?
We are a volunteer run conference and have limited capacity to offer refunds.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

### The name on the registration/ticket doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?

If there is an error with the ticket, please reach out to us and we will try to rectify it. 45 days before the event we will lock down the registration list but feel free to send someone else to claim your ticket with your registration (this is OK).
