## Transportation

DC and Northern Virginia traffic is consistently rated among the worst in the
nation, so we recommend that you do not drive, especially if you are visiting
from out of town. Instead, take the train to DevOpsDays! USPTO is located just
a few blocks from the [King Street/Old
Town](https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/king-street.cfm) station, which
is served by Metro Blue and Yellow line trains, VRE commuter trains, and several
Amtrak trains per day.

From the Metro station, go past the bus stops, through the pedestrian tunnel under
Duke Street and proceed straight ahead on Dulany Street to the USPTO, which you can
identify by the central glass Atrium that joins the East and West buildings. Enter
the atrium and find us downstairs! See the map below.

This station is also a short ride from [National Airport
(DCA)](http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport), our recommended
airport for visitors from out of town. If you are arriving at Dulles (IAD),
Baltimore (BWI), or Amtrak's Union Station, Metro's [trip
planner](https://www.wmata.com) can help you get to the event.
