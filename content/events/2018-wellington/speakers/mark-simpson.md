Mark wrote his first line of code at the age of 10 in Basic on an old Amstrad, and has never looked back. Now using far more sophisticated software and hardware, he has spent almost twenty years in the IT industry as a developer, team lead and architect, almost all of it building big web-based systems. For the last eight years, he has been at ANZ in Wellington, mainly looking after (in various ways) New Zealand’s biggest Internet Banking platform.

He now spends his days ranting about the awesome power of continuous delivery and microservices, and is a sucker for a pedantic discussion about REST APIs. Buy him a beer (craft, naturally) and he will happily debate you on the subject of your choice. 

Mark used to have a beard, but now does not. He still hasn’t come to terms with this loss.
