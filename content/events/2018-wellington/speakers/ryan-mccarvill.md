I'm currently the DevOps lead at Verifone where I work to automate payment gateways in New Zealand and Australia. Before that I was working for Fire and Emergency NZ as part of a small team to deliver a new incidence response system to emergency service workers. I used to make horrible short films but was forced to stop when all my friends got married. For some reason I keep building databases and word processors.
