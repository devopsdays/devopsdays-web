A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open tech citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. Please share Kudos via Twitter or with our special Kudo Cards (just look for our Kudo boxes http://www.happymelly.com/the-art-of-saying-thank-you/)
