One of challenges we had in our system is huge amount of parameters (literally tens of 
thousands). Such huge amount of parameters leads to long deployment preparation times. And 
things can still get "broken" too as system sometimes manipulates configuration on its 
own.

Of course the real solution is to deliver proper configuration automatically, but you need 
to start from somewhere.

The talk would share our experience from simply putting all of those parameters spread 
among hundreds of files into distributed version control. Solution seems to be "too easy" 
(Mercurial + symbolic links), but helped us a lot and allowed to identify places, where 
the system "messes itself up" and allowed to solve issues much faster. Such approach can 
be  applied as well with different DVCS and also for non-Windows platforms.

I'll also mention the importance of working with users and that value of them is much more 
important than technical excellence.

It hope it will be inspiring for people who have a similar challenge in front of them, but 
somehow don't know how to start or don't believe such a simple thing will work.s
