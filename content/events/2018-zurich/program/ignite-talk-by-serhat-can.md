It is clear that Serverless is redefining DevOps. But, Serverless is not a silver bullet
nor NoOps. Serverless removes some of the complexity but it brings whole different kind of
challenges. While challenges are changing, DevOps is not going anywhere anytime soon!

The goal of this lightning talk is to make people realize that abstracting some of the
complexity does not mean #NoOps. Starting with what Serverless is and is not, I will
explain in which steps we need DevOps to the ultimate goal of running successful
serverless applications on production. The steps like testing, deploying, monitoring is
not going anywhere. Some of the steps become a lot more difficult in Serverless
environments. The need for observability is still one of the most important things if you
are running in production. Hence, you need proper logging, distributed tracing,
monitoring, and alerting. Also, security is still a top concern while new challenges like
cold starts adding extra complexity to Serverless environments.
