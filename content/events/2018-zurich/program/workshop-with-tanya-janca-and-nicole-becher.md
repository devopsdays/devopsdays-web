DevOps is like a revolution of your IT in many ways. To encourage that it, Swisscom set up
a dedicated Tribe to support the revolution. As part of the "Enabling Services" Tribe, the
"DevOps Services" Squad provides services around CI/CD and the software development
lifecycle. In this talk, we like to demonstrate the benefit of such a dedicated team and
how it boosts your transformation. Giving your teams the right tools, even if you work in
a strongly regulated environment is crucial. The "DevOps Services" Squad used leading
technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus and much more to
provide a SaaS stack within Swisscom. Apart from why and how they build it, you will get
the chance to see it in action.
