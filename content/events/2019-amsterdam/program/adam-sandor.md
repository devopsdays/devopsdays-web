Creating Operators is the most versatile way to manage applications running on top of Kubernetes. Is it a bad idea to write one using Java instead of Go? Java is no dinosaur as many like to think - the language has been revamped in recent years and the runtime is rapidly improving. It also has a first-class Kubernetes SDK and thousands of development teams for whom it is the primary language. I will show how much effort is creating an Operator using Java is and also go into when and why would one write an Operator in the first place, regardless of the language.
