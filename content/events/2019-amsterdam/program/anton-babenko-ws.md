It is easy to get started with Terraform to manage infrastructure as code. Just read the documentation on terraform.io, and you are done. Almost.

The harder part begins when infrastructure grows in all directions (several AWS/GCP accounts, regions, teams, projects, environments, external integrations). One of the most frequent questions is "how to structure code".

In this workshop, I will explain many of challenges related to that, what works, what does not work, why so, and most importantly I will show all the code which works from small projects to very-large infrastructures (featuring multi-cloud and multi-region setup).

This workshop is best suitable for people who have been using Terraform at least for some time and already have practical questions, but there will be some basic information for newcomers also.

All the slides, code and workshop material will be provided to attendees. Most of the content used for the workshop you can find on my site here - www.terraform-best-practices.com
