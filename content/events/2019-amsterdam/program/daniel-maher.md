Interesting in speaking at a conference or meet-up, but don't know where to start? Have a great idea for a talk but your proposals keep getting rejected? Or maybe your talk has been accepted but you're nervous about being on stage?

Don't worryâ€”we'll get you sorted.

In this workshop, we'll work through things like idea generation, the CFP process, the art of the slide, stage presence, and more. Attendees can come with material they'd like help with, but people who are totally new to the game are more than welcome too!
