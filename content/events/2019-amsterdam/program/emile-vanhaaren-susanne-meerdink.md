KPN ICT Consulting uses Design Thinking as a development tool. Design Thinking is a way of working with a strong focus on realizing a design that is feasible and useful. During this workshop the starting point is a DevOps team that develops a sleep analyzing application. We are going to find out how design thinking can help developers get more insight out of user feedback and reduce the amount of times they go through the loop. With the help of some specific tools we like to introduce the participants to design thinking.

No dedicated knowledge needed. Only some experience in DevOps.
