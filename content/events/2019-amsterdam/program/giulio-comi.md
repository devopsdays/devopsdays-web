The workshop that I would like to prepare is an hands-on extension of my recent blog article available here (https://www.secjuice.com/how-to-harden-docker-containers/). The aim of the 2.5 hours training is to share what tools and considerations have worked for me during the hardening process. To aid in the explanation I will take in consideration an already available docker image (e.g. Wordpress or Joomla).
At the end of the workshop the partecipants will have a clearer picture of the multiple steps involved to have a more secure Docker image by only adopting open source tools.

Partecipants should have already installed an up to date version of Docker. They are also required to have an internet access.
Only open source tools will be presented and used.
