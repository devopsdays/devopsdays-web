As your applications become composed of more and more microservices, managing and coordinating all of those services can become difficult. Which services are communicating with each other? Are they communicating securely? And most importantly, how can you know?

This workshop will get you started creating a service mesh with Istio on Kubernetes. We’ll start the workshop by setting up Istio with a microservices application and reviewing some of the features that Istio provides. Then we’ll take it a step further by observing mocked production issues and working with Istio to debug and solve them.
