At binx.io we do not believe in classic, classroom training for IT professional. We know that most IT professionals learn ‘on the job’ and it’s hard for them to spend 5 days in a classroom.

AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This file serves as a single source of truth for your cloud environment.

The training consists of a short but complete introduction into AWS CloudFormation technologies and practices, followed by a series of hands-on training exercises. The exercises simulate real-life scenarios and will teach best practices while doing it.

This workshop takes 2.5 hours in total and is intended if you have no or little experience with CloudFormation.

Examples of scenarios you will find in this workshop:
- run your first EC2 Instances using CloudFormation
- building more powerful templates using built-in helpers
- run multiple resources and stacks including relations
- optimize your template for re-use
- optimize deployment for safety
- troubleshoot common deployment problems
- use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

Bring:
- A laptop with Python 3 and Docker installed
- An AWS Account

After this session, you can take it one step further in the workshop: AWS CloudFormation - High-Intensity Training Advanced
