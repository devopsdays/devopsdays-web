Come to this workshop to learn how to build serverless applications using AWS Lambda. You will learn the basics of AWS Lambda as well as the Serverless framework. You will learn how to deploy your functions, write tests and run functions locally, and how to set up CI/CD for your project.

To make the most of this workshop, you should have basic understanding of AWS. Students would need the following:
* an AWS account
* an admin user on the account
* Node.js 8.x installed on their machine
