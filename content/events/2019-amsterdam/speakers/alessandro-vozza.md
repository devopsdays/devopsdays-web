Alessandro has been around Open Source for as long as he can remember, and he started cultivating the DevOps community in Amsterdam when it was not an hype. After many transitions, he now settled as Technical Evangelist for Microsoft, pushing for adoption of state of the art DevOps and Cloud Native practices and culture across different industries and communities.
