Joep is a technologist with team building skills. He likes all things infrastructure (cloud, storage, virtualization), but really shines when it comes to DevOps and Infra-as-Code.

Once a virtualization and storage consultant, he built IaaS-platforms, created an army of Community Managers, built, led and developed a team of technical architects.
Most recently, Joep is building the Jumbo Tech Campus. Jumbo is the second biggest supermarket in the Netherlands and the fastest growing online supermarket of the Netherlands.

As the Technical Pathfinder, Joep is responsible for the DevOps way-of-work, tooling, cloud and open source strategy of the Tech Campus, the e-commerce software development house of Jumbo.

He runs his own blog, VirtualLifestyle.nl, speaks at industry events, and he's a frequent delegate for TechFieldDay events.
