I have been developing and building web scale apps for the most of my life, from writing SDKs for Android and iOS which are delivered to millions of people across the globe, to overseeing the migration of a 2TB database in under 7 hours (in-house proprietary time series database).

I'm on a journey to build the next cloud platform for highly available and scalable apps - Asyncy and Storyscript, both of which are fully open source projects.
