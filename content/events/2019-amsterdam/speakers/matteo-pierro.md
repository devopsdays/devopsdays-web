Hi, my name is Matteo and I’m a Software Craftsman and a Technical Coach.
eXtreme Programming practitioner and TDD lover, I’m very passionate about creating well crafted software that delivers high value to the customer.

I’m addicted to conferences and meetups. I love to share knowledge with people in order to improve myself and hopefully inspire other people.
