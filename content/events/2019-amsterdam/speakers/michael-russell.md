and everything else users need to be successful. He has a passion for building battle hardened
infrastructure and loves monitoring and automation. His most recent open source project is kuberwatcher

Kubernetes labels and annotations. He is also working on a personal project called lope

testing tooling identically across all environments and operating systems.
