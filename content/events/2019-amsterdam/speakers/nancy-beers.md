Happy Scrum Master!
I finally found out what I want to be when I grow up!

I love coaching my team members and organisation towards Agility and understanding Scrum and other Agile practices. Facilitating sessions makes me happy, as well as helping people delivering value and stay passionate about what they are doing. Oh, that and Lego.

I organise weeklong hackathons, speak at events, play serious games, attend hacker festivals and bounce through live with a lot of energy and positivity.
I will forever stay an Open Source Hippie and a social engineer.
I am a strong evangelist for Playfulness.
