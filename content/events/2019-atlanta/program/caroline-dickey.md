Before a car can be sold, it must be crash tested to assess its safety and resilience. Chaos engineering is a method for testing software in the same way. This talk explores the similarities between crash testing and chaos engineering and why the latter should be part of every engineerâ€™s toolbox.

Chaos engineering refers to a practice that is common in many industries but still new to the software world: testing a product under degraded conditions to ensure that the impact of the condition is both known and contained. Using crash tests as a metaphor, this talk explores the definition and goals of chaos engineering and offers suggestions on how you can add some chaos to your own software development process.
