Doughnuts are made out of eggs, sugar, flour, a milk. An application to be useful requires compute, memory, storage, and networking. What does delicious doughnuts have to do with these pillars of infrastructure? We live in a world of finite resources. There are only so many doughnuts out there.

We live in a world of finite resources. There are only so many doughnuts and so much infrastructure to run and power our applications. Resource Managers are crucial to make sure our applications have the firepower to run and be placed on the most efficient infrastructure. Letâ€™s look at varying requests for doughnuts and how popular resource manager algorithms work. We will touch on fundamentals on scheduling, searching, assignments, and constraints when fulfilling our quest for doughnuts.
