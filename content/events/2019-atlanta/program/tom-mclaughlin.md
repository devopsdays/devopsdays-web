Title = "Serverless DevOps: What do we do when the server goes away?"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["tom-mclaughlin"]
+++

As DevOps was disruptive to operations, serverless will start a new disruption cycle. We will see more of our operational responsibilities removed again. To define our new role we will need to understand how serverless will effect us and where our value is to our organizations.

With the rise of serverless architecture, many of the common day-to-day operations tasks will change dramatically, if not disappear completely. We as operations professionals will be challenged to redefine our roles and responsibilities within the technology organization as serverless abstracts away the server and its respective OS to cloud service providers. In order to redefine our role, we must first understand how serverless adoption effects our organizations as well as understand the value of our work as seen by the eyes of our employers.

This is not a serverless tech talk! The talk focuses on understanding how technical change affects our role as operations engineers. We cover these ideas through the shift to serverless but the themes and ideas are applicable even to those just making the leap from on-prem to public cloud.

This talk will cover:

What is this thing we call serverless?
The impact of its adoption by your organization on your operations role.

Engineering team realignment (how to get rid of your ops team but retain your ops people).

The new operations role and responsibilities.

Becoming more connected to the business needs of your organization.

Building products and not projects for your user.

The audience should come away with a better understanding of their value as operations engineers, how to demonstrate it, and how to respond to technical change in their organization as they see technology or their cloud provider assuming more of their role’s responsibilities.
