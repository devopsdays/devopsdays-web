Some people learn by reading. Some by watching videos. Apparently I learn by failing and head-desking.

Learn how I super charged my Ops tooling with the power of CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and avoid the mistakes I made along the way.

While my tooling is PowerShell based, my aim is to show how easy it can be to leverage Azure DevOps services for almost any use case.
