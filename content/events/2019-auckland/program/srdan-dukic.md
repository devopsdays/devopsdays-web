The push for automation in our daily work brings up a moral dilemma of sorts, namely whether or not we have a responsibility to let people know that the work is being performed by code.

This dilemma has parallels to the early days of Lean/TPS where workers were encouraged to find improvements to the production systems even if it meant that the resulting efficiencies would lead to a lack of demand for skills. This talks looks at the implicit agreements made between the organization and workers where one committed to ensuring that employees would have work as long as there was a commitment to learning/retraining.

It is hoped that this talk inspires open discussion and thought around investment and motivation in learning and training.
