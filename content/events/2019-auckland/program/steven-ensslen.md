This talk addresses the pressing problem of data quality, and proposes DataOps as the solution.

Businesses today don’t have a black and white divide between staff who write programs and staff who don’t. In large enterprises, most of the staff write some software. There is a continuum between the people who dabble in excel formulas through to the core application developers. Most of the middle analyze data. Few of those people have been exposed to the transformational ideas of DevOps, or even Agile. DataOps is, mostly, DevOps for data analysts. These data analysts benefit from applying CALMS to their work.
