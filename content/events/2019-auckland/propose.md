### Proposal Guidelines
We do not have a theme for this year's conference, so we would love to hear your DevOps story. If you're struggling for ideas, you may find the following helpful:

* When applying DevOps principles what are are the quantitative and qualitative relationships between business, money and decision making vs “automate and monitor all the things”
* We are a number of years into DevOps but is DevOps still a new thing for your organisation?
* What is the impact of cross-silo collaboration beyond just dev & ops.
* Do we understand the impacts of preference and bias?
* Did our happiness increase and did we reduce burnout through the DevOps principles?
* Examples of organisational approaches to manage uncertainty.
* Does Cloud Native differ from DevOps? - has this changed approaches to managing compute instances, configuration, monitoring/observability.
* Are our approaches to observability, chaos engineering enough?
* Has your organisation bridged the gap beyond the technical teams e.g. tech and sales, support, supply and business pipelines.
* How to support your employees and help them learn and make a good career.
* How you have shaped DevOps to your context.
* How hard was doing the DevOps.
* What did we learn about ourselves, organisation and DevOps while doing the DevOps?

### Equal Opportunity
DevOpsDays Auckland 2019 is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to invite people of all backgrounds and profiles to submit presentation proposals. All potential speakers receive consideration without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, ability or age.

We also encourage those who have not presented before and can offer support to anyone who would like to submit a proposal. Please email us [{{< email_proposals >}}] with any questions.  Even better, submit your proposal and let us know it’s your first presentation. We can offer support that includes a review of your CFP content, speaking and presentation coaching/tips, travel, and accommodation assistance.

### Proposals
There are three types of sessions:

1. __A plenary presentation__ during the conference: these are 30-minute slots that have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody is in the one room.
2. __An Ignite talk__ that will be presented during the <a href="https://devopsdays.org/pages/ignite-talks-format" target="blank"> Ignite Talks</a>. These are 5-minute slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) presented to all attendees in one room
3. __Workshop - Technical Presentation - Tutorial__ These run during the open spaces sessions and have an optional and a fixed attendance. These can range in length from 30-45 mins.

We cannot guarantee sufficient wifi for any presentation or workshop. Please have options if your proposal requires an internet connection.

<hr/>
Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- __Broad appeal__: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- __New local presenters__: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes of being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- __Under-represented voices__: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you’re in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you’re in a large, traditional organisation, or you’re the only person at your organisation with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- __Original content__: We prefer talks not already presented at another event, especially another one in the local area or one available in recorded form.
- __No third-party submissions__: If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you’ve already shown that as a speaker you’re distant from the process. This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organisers and participants.
- __No vendor pitches__: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
- __Speaker only submissions__: Submissions must be made by one of the presenters; we do not accept proposals submitted on behalf of others.
- __Code of Conduct__: All presentations must conform to the DevOpsDays code of conduct.

### Financial Assistance
For Plenary & Technical/Workshop/Tutorial speakers - if your employer does not cover travel expenses you incur as a speaker, at the discretion of the organisers, the conference may provide financial assistance for travel and accommodation expenses.

If you require financial assistance to present, please outline what costs need covering (i.e. where you’re travelling from) with your submission.
