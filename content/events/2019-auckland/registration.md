### Diversity Scholarship Information
<p>The DevOpsDays Auckland’s diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend DevOpsDays events for financial reasons.
Equal access and diversity are important to us at the DevOpsDays Auckland conference. We want you at our events, and we want to help get you there! Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection is limited and will be made by a group of reviewers who will assess each applicant’s request.</p>
<p>Scholarship recipients will receive a complimentary registration pass (non-transferrable). We may consider travel and accommodation support for recipients who need it.</p>

### Eligibility
<p>Applicants must be from a traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of colour, students, persons with disabilities; and be unable to attend without some financial assistance.</p>
