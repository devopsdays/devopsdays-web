Brooke majored in economics & psychology, and still isn’t clear how she ended up being part of the technology community. Starting out her career in internal audit and risk advisory, she quickly learnt that understanding theories and frameworks wasn’t enough & that really her passion was to practically transform how people work. 

Brooke has been a technology Transformation Lead at ANZ Bank for the past two years focusing on the real easy things: people & process. 

Brooke accepts her millennial stereotype only for the fact that her dog Ella is treated like her first born child. Her favourite activities will include any combination of food, wine, travel & sunshine.
