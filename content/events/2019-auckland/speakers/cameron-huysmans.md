Cameron is a Senior Solutions Engineer at HashiCorp. His work experience ranges from one of the largest companies (IBM) to one of the smallest (his own). In that time he has held mostly technical roles; service desk, team leader, technical services manager, presales technical, director and also a brief sales stint (where he learnt that wasn’t for him).

Prior to HashiCorp he came to understand the power of cloud & automation and spent the previous 4 years convincing and migrating some of Melbourne’s smaller companies to it.

Outside of work he is 2 parts dad, 1 part futsal player, 1 part geek and always a coffee snob (he is from Melbourne after all).
