I’m a developer and lead consultant at ThoughtWorks. I spend my time helping our clients solve gnarly technical problems. My particular interests include hardware, DevOps and improving the developer experience (developers are users too!).

I’ve worked with clients from a range of industries, including financial services, retail, wholesale and distribution, personal fitness, energy and high-frequency trading.

When I’m not at work, you’ll find me travelling, taking photos, eating chocolate and playing with Lego. (Usually not all at once.)
