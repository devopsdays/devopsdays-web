Craig Box leads the Cloud Native advocacy team at Google Cloud. He has worked with customers and communities since the launch of Kubernetes in 2014, and has delivered talks on 6 continents, including a KubeCon keynote. He is the co-host of the Kubernetes Podcast from Google.

Craig has a Computer Science degree from the University of Waikato. He started his career in IT consulting in New Zealand, as he was concerned that programming involved sitting in dark rooms. He has over 15 years of experience in systems administration, deployment, DevOps, consulting, advisory and management roles around the world.

Craig and his partner Fern, also from New Zealand, have lived in London for the past decade, and both expect to be bitter about this yearâ€™s Cricket World Cup for some time.
