It is a miracle that David is still alive, having accumulated multiple scars in 16 years of engineering research, 20 years of software development and 6 years with the guilty look of DevOps about him. And that’s just during working hours. On weekends, he’s either pedaling slowly uphill or fast downhill (occasionally missing trees), or hurtling around curvy back roads (always within legal speed limits!) in an open-top sports car. 

To atone for his on-going vices, and allow time for injuries to heal, David has taken to teaching the virtues of speaking in ways that encourage others to listen, and listening in ways that encourage others to speak. He has taught a Nonviolent Communication course over 20 times at Fraedom, including to senior leaders. His wife and 3 adult children find this a less worrisome pastime, and it has resulted in less scars at home, too. 

David’s wit is dry, rather than sparkling - but he is serious about wanting to make life more wonderful for others.
