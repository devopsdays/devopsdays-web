Jane Miceli is the Cloud Enterprise Architect at Micron Technology. She has held technical positions all over the stack at HP Inc, Rockwell Automation, Bodybuilding.com, Sensus, Silverback Learning Solutions and Micron Technology.


Jane got into devops though automation and quality assurance. It seemed like devops had the most interesting work and stories. Devops feels like it was a bigger impact then developing software. Devops is the gateway to the cloud.

Jane is passionate about women in technology and originally started Girl Develop It! Boise chapter. For fun, she enjoys scuba diving with the non-profit Neptune Warrior supporting veterans.
