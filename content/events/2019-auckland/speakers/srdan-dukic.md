Most of the time you’ll find me wrestling with CI pipelines, deployment scripts and trying to figure out teams and the organizations they fit into. I like to read the occasional SciFi story and frankly don’t care whether you call me a DevOps Engineer or SRE as long as I have the autonomy to make my work easier :-)
