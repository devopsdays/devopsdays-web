Iâ€™m a leader in data. I work to replace ignorance with knowledge by reducing uncertainty. I gather information that answers important questions and I help to define the questions that need answering.

Along the way I use analytical software and databases. I automate scrupulously. And I build teams by teaching my peers to do these things too.
