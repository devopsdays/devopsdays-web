<p>We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring our event, please drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}</p>

<p>Returning to Auckland, DevOpsDays provides an opportunity to expose your brand to the DevOps community across NZ - whether you're looking for talent, wanting to extend the reach of your brand or just show the latest and greatest wares. Sponsoring DevOpsDays in Auckland is a unique occasion to interact with technology professionals and gives your representatives a chance to connect with participants.</p>

### Sponsorship Packages
<p>We'll be releasing the sponsorship prospectus shortly, in the mean time we have confirmed the following sponsorship packages:</p>

<p>Sponsors are much appreciated for their financial assistance. Sponsorship is the main source of funding for the conference, with registration fees kept low to encourage broad community participation.</p>

<p>Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the participants as peers. Any participant has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the participants. The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.</p>
