You can get a $10 ride credit** with Lyft! Even better, Lyft will donate $10 to Evergreen for every person who uses the code.

How it works:

1. Download the Lyft app
1. Enter the promo code EVERGREEN10 for your first ride.
1. Request a ride, hit the road & celebrate Lyft's donation to Evergreen!
1. That's not all - returning Lyft customers can also use the promo code EVERGREENGO to get $5 off up to six rides to or from Evergreen Brick Works

** $10 ride credit can be used for any pickup or destination, not just Evergreen Brick Works. Ride credit is only valid for your first ride with Lyft.

### Driving
