<strong>
  Proposals are closed for 2019. Please consider sending a proposal in 2020!
</strong>

There are three ways to propose a topic at devopsdays:
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong><em>A 30-minute talk</em></strong> presented during the conference,
    usually in the mornings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> presented during the
    <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format">Ignite sessions</a> (scheduling
    varies). These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20
    slides total).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><em>Open Space</em></strong>: If you would like to lead a group
    discussion during the attendee-suggested
    <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions, it is
    not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in
    person at the conference. If you would like to demo your product or service,
    you should <a href="../sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and demo it at your
    table.
</ol>

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _local presenters_: Preference will be given to presenters who live or work
within 100 miles of Baltimore, MD.
- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety
of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the
whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very
interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area.
We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _underrepresented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that
may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you are in a field not
typically thought of as a technology field, you are in a large, traditional
organization, or you are the only person at your organization with your
background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We will consider talks that have already been presented
elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area is not likely to have already
seen.
- _no third-party submissions_: This is a small community-driven event, and
speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR
firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you have already shown
that, as a speaker, you are distant from the process.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not
going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
