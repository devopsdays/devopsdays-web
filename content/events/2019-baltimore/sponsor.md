DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends on your sponsorships. DevOpsDays Baltimore does not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. We recommend sending practitioners to interact with their peers at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

All attendees also have the opportunity to demonstrate products or projects as part of an open space session.

All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
