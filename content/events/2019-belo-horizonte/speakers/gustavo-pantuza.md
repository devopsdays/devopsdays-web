I am a software engineer who loves computer science. From its most simple basis to its more obscure problem.<br> 
I think Free Software and Open Source are the way, as a computer scientist, I can make some difference to the world around me. Sharing knowledge and mentoring younger developers is one my favorite tasks. It is a way of giving back to the community what one day was given to me.
