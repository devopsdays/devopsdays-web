As part of this workshop attendees will receive a state-of-the-art DevSecOps tool-chest comprising of various open-source tools and scripts to help the DevOps engineers in automating security within the CI/CD pipeline. While the workshop uses Java/J2EE framework, the workshop is language agnostic and similar tools can be used against other application development frameworks.

The workshop will also present various case studies on how critical bugs and security breaches affecting popular software and applications could have been prevented using a simple DevSecOps approach.

* Create a security culture/mindset amongst the already integrated “DevOps” team.
* Find and fix security bugs as early in SDLC as possible.
* The culture promotes the philosophy “security is everyone’s problem”.
* Integrate all security software centrally and utilize the results more effectively.
* Measure and shrink the attack surface
