As a Woman in Tech, I’ve experienced my fair share of self-doubt. It wasn’t until a year or two ago that I learned of Imposter Syndrome, something clicked; like someone handed me a cheat sheet to a jigsaw puzzle. Since then I’ve been learning more about psychology and why people react in a certain way to situations and how my own mind fits into all of this. Nearly 70% of people in tech have said they’ve experience Imposter Syndrome in some way. I want to take you on a journey through my career and what I’ve been doing to fight that Imposter Goblin. The one that won’t stop shouting when you’re trying to be your best self.
