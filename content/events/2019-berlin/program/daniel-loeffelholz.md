Healthy collaboration and engagement are one of the number one success factors of modern projects. But such team behaviour doesn’t necessarily comes out of nowhere - it requires conscious effort from people, who want to take ownership and drive the projects’ success. Leading without Authority is a style, that supports such behaviour and doesn’t require formal authority. It’s an effective and helpful approach for people that want to increase their impact or leaders that seek to create a healthy and high-performing team. In this talk, I’ll share the three steps how to: 1. identify how everyone can contribute and take up leadership responsiblity in accordance to what the team needs and their personal profile 2. how to influence and lead from within a team and 3. How to reiterate and adjust your strategy.
