For the first years of the serverless era, shift to serverless was misunderstood as getting rid of operational concerns because the vendor takes care of scalability of the application. It certainly adds efficiency to software teams and reduces the need for ops people who are dedicated to keep the systems up and running. However, it doesnâ€™t directly mean firing ops people and hiring more serverless developers instead. Ops people have their chance of being indispensable to their team by adopting their ops characteristics to the serverless world. Gaining the ability to deploy, monitor and secure serverless applications will completely diminish the barrier between product teams and ops folks.
