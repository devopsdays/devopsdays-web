More and more teams are looking for ways to iterate gradually and validate their ideas with data. Techniques like A/B testing, feature flagging, and gradual rollouts are quickly going from niche to mainstream. More experimentation means faster development and better products. But like any trend, product experimentation is a good idea that can easily go wrong. For every game-changing A/B test, there’s a trail of testing mistakes that led well-meaning teams down the wrong path.

We’ll focus on the beginning of the product experimentation journey – feature management and feature rollouts. When used strategically and thoughtfully, feature flags can be powerful tools in mitigating risk in your development cycle. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release — but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags?

In this hands-on technical workshop, attendees will learn how to strategically create feature flags in multiple development environments and roll them out to a subset of their customers. We’ll talk briefly about the possibilities feature flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system.
