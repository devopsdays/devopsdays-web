Our team is building a platform for Software and Infrastructure as a Service fully based on Open Source. We develop the platform, support our products, and be on call as well.
When i started working on that team, i had no idea about DevOps or what it's about. Especially what all this means in, at least my, reality?  What does DevOps mean to "new‚Äù ones in our industry?

This ignite is a shot summary about how I see DevOps after being part of a team for over two and half years and especially what some DevOps ideas mean to us as a team and a company.
