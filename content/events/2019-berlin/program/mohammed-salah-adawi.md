Introduction

Optimizing the flow, amplifying the feedback loops and establishing a continual learning and experimentation environment while having several distributed teams working together is not an easy job. On one hand, establishing effective collaboration model between such teams requires special handling. Especially when considering the different barriers including the different locations, different languages and cultures. On the other hand, security regulations are usually more complicated when working on several locations. Security regulations are not an option. but complying with those regulations may cost a lot of time and effort.

Scope

In this session, we will be looking into the different challenges of DevOps adoption in an offshore / onshore distributed project. And how to overcome those challenges one by one.
