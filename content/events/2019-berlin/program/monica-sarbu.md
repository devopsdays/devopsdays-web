Monica will share her experience as a woman in tech. From once being a female college graduate that no one was likely to trust, to now being in the driving seat of key technical product development decisions, Monica has embraced so many opportunities from both a personal and professional perspective and is excited to share her journey with the audience.

The story combined with real statistics has the purpose to inspire and motivate not only women in tech, but especially the male audience. Because many of the biases are unconscious, it helps to put themselves in the shoes of a women in tech for a few minutes. We can work together on eliminating biases.
