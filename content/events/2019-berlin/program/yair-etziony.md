I would like to ask, what would be the future of DevOps as a movement and practice following specific trends I sense in our scene. I would argue that DevOps is on its way to oblivion For that, I would use theory from Water Benjamin, a Berliner thinker who lived in the early 20th century.

In more than 20 years in the field, I have seen many companies, technologies and professions come and go. Software development and IT is a very dynamic field: Blink for a moment and you will find yourself non-relevant. Nowadays when the demand for DevOps engineers is reaching an all-time high, I think itâ€™s the best time to check the past and the present in order to better understand if they will have a future. Join me when I will try to define and see if DevOps as practice makes sense, and whether it will survive current days of hype. I would like to define DevOps as a practice, then define what does it mean to be a DevOps engineer, if that role makes sense then I would like to check the simple definition of DevOps which is the tools that they used in various times. I would argue that DevOps movement is slowly moving from Avant Garde to the mainstream and that the rise in salaries and demand is a sign for the slow death of this practice.

After that, I would talk about the possible future of our field.
