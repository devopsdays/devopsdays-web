I’m a developer, consultant and tech lead trainer, working for ThoughtWorks. My professional passions are larger distributed architectures and technical leadership, with the goal of creating healthy environments and high-performing teams. During my various engagements and roles at ThoughtWorks, I was in the position to support and accompany many new tech leads and developers on their leadership journey, which was an equally insightful journey for myself as well. I’m happy to share my learnings.
