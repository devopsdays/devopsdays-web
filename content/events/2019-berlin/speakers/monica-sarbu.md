Monica Sarbu is currently Director of Engineering at Elastic, where she is leading the Ingest team that is responsible for the popular open source projects Beats and Logstash, as well as turnkey solutions built on top of the Beats platform. She is the founder of the Packetbeat open source project and the Beats co-creator.
