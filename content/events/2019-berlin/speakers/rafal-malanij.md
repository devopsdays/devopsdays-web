I’ve been in the IT industry for over 10 years. Starting as a tech person in Deployment Management I moved over time through process management, project management and business development roles. Right now I am building a Team of Cloud Native consultants for Container Solutions Poland office.

I was involved in organisations of the first DevOps Days Warsaw in 2014. Since then I am member of Programme Committee of this conference (and many others). I was involved in setting up PyData Warsaw meetup in 2015, fully responsible for it for the past 2 years. I am chairman of PyData Warsaw Conference (2 editions already) that gathers over 400 Data Science enthusiast.

Personally I am interested in technology with the focus on Cloud Computing, DevOps, Data Science/Machine Learning and Genomics.
