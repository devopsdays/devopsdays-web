M.S. & B.S. Computer Science at UCLV, with +8 year of experience building enterprise software solution. I’ve been working as Software Engineer, Team lead and automation nut. I work as Operations Engineer & DevOps Advocate at Pyxis. I’m member of the company team that drives adoption of new technologies and I’m constantly involved in automation and exploring ways to do it properly and as risk free as possible. I have strong interest in DevOps and BigData challenges. I’m part of the team that usually support the transition to a microservice oriented architecture on immutable infrastructure, containers and elastic partitioning.
Collaterally, I work as an organizer and regular speaker at international conferences and IT workshops in Cuba, addressing issues of the DevOps cultural movement, and I am an active member of the Docker community.
When I’m not writing codes or researching new technologies, I enjoys traveling and sharing my knowledges with other like minded professionals who want to make the world more awesome. Outside of work, I loves spending time with family and building exciting projects.
