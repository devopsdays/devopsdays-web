I am a Senior Architecture and Software Development expert with more than 18 Years of experience in different business as Telco, Health Care, Banking, Digital Marketing, among others. I specialized in software development processes and software architecture & design. Many activities related to design and implementation optimization under different technologies, and platforms.

My passion is to help customers to solve real problems with the right use of technology. Ranging from the Business Technology Strategy to Design and Human Dynamics. Transition to the cloud and integration of cross platform systems is a big part of it. In most of the cases, during that process, my work covers the interaction with multidisciplinary teams that include CxO, Engineering, Operations, and Development people.

Since university I’ve been a fanatic of AI and embedded systems, Right now is a very exciting time for that.
