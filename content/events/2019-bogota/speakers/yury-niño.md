Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing, implementing and managing the development of software applications using the agile methodologies scrum and kanban. 3+ years of hands-on experience supporting, automating, and optimizing mission-critical deployments in AWS, leveraging configuration management, CI/CD, and DevOps processes.
I have a strong background in cloud architectures and foundations in the design, development and deployment of software applications. I have experience in business software systems development, both on the coding and deploying sides. I have worked as a Professor of Software Engineering and Researcher. I am interested in investigating how the project management skills can be improved and how the resources and times of a project can be optimized using mining software repositories and big data.
