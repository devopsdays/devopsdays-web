It is a pleasure to invite you to participate in the  devopsdays Boise Conference. The conference will take place at {{< event_location >}} in downtown Boise on {{< event_start >}}.

This is a technical conference aimed at sharing and improving the current software development practices of local technology businesses. Sharing these practices benefits all industries and makes our region more competitive and attractive to the constrained talent pool. Every year we plan to inspire local technical and business leaders with a world class line up of presentations.

Our main purpose in hosting this event is to create an opportunity for the software community to share leading edge technologies and processes that improve the speed, reliability, and security of software development. The presentations will focus on evolving technical and architectural practices and the methods needed to lead change efforts in software groups and organizations. The goal is to give leaders the tools and practices they need to develop and deploy software faster and to win in the marketplace.

Prospective speakers are invited to contribute presentation outlines for general audience presentations and breakout sessions lasting 45 minutes. Topics cover the broad range of stories that detail improving software delivery through development and operations process improvements.

Topics of interest include:

* Continuous Integration: strategies to effectively coordinate developers.
* Continuous Delivery: strategies to improve quality and frequency of code deployments.
* Test Automation: best practices for creating reliable and maintainable automated tests.
* Edge Computing: streamlining the flow of traffic from IoT devices and providing real-time local data analysis
* Environment Management: efficient creation, deployment, and decommissioning of environment stacks for development, test, production.
* Software Architecture: patterns to improve development efficiency through design
* Moving to the Cloud: strategies for moving code from data center to cloud hosting service
* Working with Legacy Code: how to improve throughput and reliability when working with tightly coupled systems
* Software Pipelines: design and implementation of an effective pipeline
* Monitoring: ensuring service uptime and quick resolution of issues
* Agile Planning and Requirements Management

Please feel free to propose additional topics that you think may be of interest!

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn't likely to have already seen.
- _no third-party submissions_: This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
