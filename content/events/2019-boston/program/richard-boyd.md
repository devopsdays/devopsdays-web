title: "Building a full CI/CD deployment pipeline for your serverless application"
Type: "talk"
Speakers: ["richard-boyd"]

Starting with an empty code repository, we will build an entire CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, deploys, tests, reverts (hopefully not), and tests your code in production. During this workshop we will incrementally build this infrastructure utilizing cloudformation and attendees will walk away with a set of templates they can take to their friends to show them the light that devops provides. Once the pipeline is set up, a developer needs only to commit their changes and the aws-managed services will handle building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the change.
