Given the current dearth of ethics education in modern computer science curricula, it is important that we expose ourselves to the fundamentals of digital ethics and learn about its history so that we can steer the industry in a new direction. Almost every day we learn of new ethical failures in the industry, and as individuals and organizations we have an obligation to humanity to educate ourselves on ethical foundations and then practice them in our day-to-day work. In this talk you will learn the history of digital ethics, the tenets of the EUâ€™s Responsible Research and Innovation framework, and identify areas for improvement in building and maintaining digital infrastructure. You will walk away with skills that you can implement in your everyday life as a developer to help you make more ethical choices in your work and life.
