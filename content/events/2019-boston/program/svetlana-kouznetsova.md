title: "Accessibility: Coding and Beyond"
Type: "talk"
Speakers: ["svetlana-kouznetsova"]

Accessibility is for everyone and is a responsibility of all team members. While a lot of web accessibility guidelines are focused on coding, there are other accessibility components that all team members need to consider in order to improve the overall product or service from the beginning of any projects. Sveta will share her personal experience as a deaf person and some examples of accessibility issues and solutions. They may be new to some and sound like common sense to others, but sadly there are many products and services that fail at accessibility. The talk will help developers and their team members better understand why accessibility is not just about coding and why itâ€™s not to be used as an afterthought.
