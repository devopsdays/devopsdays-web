The widespread adoption of test automation has led to numerous challenges that range from development lifecycle integration to simple scripting strategy. Just because a scenario CAN be automated does not mean it SHOULD be automated. Teams that adopt automation often rush to automate everything they can â€“ the automation firehose. For those scenarios that should automated, every team must adopt an implementation plan to ensure value is derived from reliable automated test execution.
