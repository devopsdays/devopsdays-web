I am passionate about growing and developing people. I support my clients in solving complex technical problems by providing leaders, process and solutions. I believe real partnerships are built on trust and take great pride in my ability to become a trusted advisor and coach for my clients and community.

Leaders need trusted advisers who are accountable for results and take a “No Excuse/Oz Principles” attitude. I work everyday to better myself, my team and my systems to uphold these principles.
