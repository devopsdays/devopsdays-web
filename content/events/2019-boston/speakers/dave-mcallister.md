Currently running community and technical evangelism for Scalyr, Dave is working with DevOps, developers and architects to understand the advantages of modern microservice architectures and orchestration to solve large-scale distributed systems challenges, especially for today’s fast-moving cycles. Dave has been a champion for open systems and open source from the early days of Linux, through open distributed file systems like XFS, GFS, and GlusterFS to today’s world of clouds and containers. He often speaks on topics such as the real-world issues associated with emerging software architectures and practices, on open source software and on creating new technology companies.

Dave has spoken on technical topics like distributed request tracing, monitoring in a Kubernetes environment, IOT messaging standards and how scale impacts IoT decisions in connected cars as well as things like marketing in an open source world and building communities for developers.

Well versed in trivia, he won a Golden Penguin in 2002. He has held seats on Advisory Boards for Sistina, Woven Systems, Pathworks, Zetera, and ConcreteCMS.

Dave was named as one of the top ten pioneers in open source by Computer Business Review, having cut his teeth on Linux and compilers before the phrase “open source” was coined.
