I’m a DevOps Advocate for Google Cloud Platform. My job is about talking with DevOps practitioners: listening to stories, telling stories, sharing a healthy cry. Prior to Google, I was the CTO of OvationTix, a tech startup in the performing arts industry, where I specialized in feeding memory to Java servers. I have chosen on purpose to live in New Jersey, where I enjoy cooking, indie rock, and fatherhood.
