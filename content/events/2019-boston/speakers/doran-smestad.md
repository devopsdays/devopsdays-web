I’m a DevOps nerd. Give me problems to solve and systems to automate! During the day I’m a programmer, systems engineer, and security specialist. At night, I’m pretty much the same but managing a personal set of servers instead. In my remaining free time, I can be found rock climbing, doing various DIY home improvement projects, and playing video games.
