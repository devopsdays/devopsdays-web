Joseph is an Ecosystem Engineer at Packet, with past IaaS experience which includes SoftLayer, DigitalOcean, Platform9 Systems, as well as infrastructure engineering at Recurly and Simple Finance, and is obsessive about automation and environment programmability. Passionate about taking the legwork out of Operations, Joseph seeks to get infrastructure right the first time through careful planning, accounting for failure, and clean execution after recovery to guide tool selection; a lofty goal, but one he hopes becomes more achievable with enough process and predictability, and one that, in a very-distant (but hopefully nearing) future, signals the end of a need to ever be on-call, or re-architecture, again.

Everyone knows Zayn was the best member of One Direction.
