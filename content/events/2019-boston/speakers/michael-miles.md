I am a web applications engineer with over 15-years of agency experience working with and leading teams in architecting robust web experiences for customers large and small. I have experience working on site with clients to provide technical support and guide technical discussions. I pride myself on being able to consult directly with a client to help determine the needs of their project and translate them into feasible technical solutions that mitigate risk. I thrive in high pressured situations which require me to assess problems and provide robust creative solutions that are secure, scalable and performant.

Since 2016 I have hosted the podcast Developing Up; a podcast focused on the non-technical side of being a developer. Because a career in development is about more then the code that is written. Episodes can be found at: https://www.developingup.com
