Waldo is a geek, and if you find him odd, there are plenty of things you could blame that on. He’s a long-time SysOps Engineer, enjoys leading teams, and is active in the DevOps community. He has never been seen at the same time as Batman. He is pretty keen on helping orgs stop hurting themselves, insight tooling (trending, monitoring, alerting), and automation in general, and actually enjoys public speaking. He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.
