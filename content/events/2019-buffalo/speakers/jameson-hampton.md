Jamey is a non-binary adventurer from Buffalo, NY who wishes they were immortal so they’d have time to visit every coffee shop in the world. They’re a rails and android developer, doing both front-end and back-end work, and currently working as an engineer for Agrilyst, a data analysis platform for indoor agriculture. In their free time, they do advocacy in the transgender community, make podcasts and zines, and spend time in nature, camping and hiking.
