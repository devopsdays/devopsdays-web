Kenzie works at BCIT, as a Systems Analyst, Web Developer, Knowledge Base Administrator and Technical Writer, and Community Manager. Kenzie has a passion for communication, continuous iterative improvement, and for systemic solutions to systemic problems. Kenzie has previously spoken at PSEWeb, BCNET, Write the Docs, the International Conference on Communication & Media Studies, the Association of Internet Research Conference, DevOpsDays, and STC InterChange, and recently completed a Masterâ€™s degree in Professional Communication, having written their thesis on prosocial community within Minecraft multiplayer servers. After long debate and discussion, it has been decided that Kenzie would, at the age of 11, likely have been sorted into Gryffindor, though there are arguments to made for every house.
