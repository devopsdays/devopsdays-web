Lakshmi Baskaran is a Corporate Leader, entrepreneur and a mom of a 5 year old little charm. Throughout her exciting career, she has built and managed high performing Engineering teams for corporates and mid-sized companies. Lakshmi started her career as a software developer and progressed to become an ERP Architect. She spent the early years of her career building solutions that used to take months, if not years to bring it to production. She used to wonder if there is a different way to design and develop solutions faster. She worked in teams where engineers worked in isolation and the teams lacked a collective ownership towards the outcome.
