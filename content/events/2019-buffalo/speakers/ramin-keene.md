Ramin has spent the last 5 years working with data teams and large enterprises to put machine learning, a-b testing, and data science products into production. He’s made ALL the mistakes and then some, helping companies lose thousands, if not millions, of dollars along the way. He is currently based in Seattle and spends his time working on adversarial experimentation tools that target infrastructure and release artifacts to help teams inspect and learn about their software AFTER it has been baked and released.
