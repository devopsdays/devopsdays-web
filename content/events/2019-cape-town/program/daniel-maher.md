At first it might not seem like mixed martial arts has much to do with working as professional computer person. As somebody who’s been hospitalised as a result of both, I assure you that there are interesting and enlightening parallels. Poor work-life balance? Weird sleeping schedules? Difficulties with nutrition and diet? Toxic hero culture? Check and check.

But it’s not all doom and gloom! In both worlds, success comes as a result of hard work, dedication, and above all teamwork. What the public ends up seeing - the great and fantastic outcomes that are heralded as examples of the art - are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Underneath that are stories. Real stories about real people, full of twists and turns, where every day is a learning opportunity.

Join me as we chat about humility, empathy, trust, self-care and the value of a good project manager. And a little bit about punching things, too.
