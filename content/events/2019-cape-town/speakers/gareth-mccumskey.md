Gareth has been in web development since the early 2000's when table based designs and running your own data centers was the thing to do. In 2016, he discovered the power of building Serverless applications and hasn't looked back; eventually joining the team remotely at Serverless, Inc to help users build and optimise their Serverless applications as a Solutions Architect. He is also based out of Cape Town and spends his off time with his loving wife and two energetic sproglets that keep him on his toes.
