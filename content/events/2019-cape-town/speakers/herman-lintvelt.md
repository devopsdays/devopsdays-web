Herman started coding in primary school and, shortly after receiving his Computer Science degree at Stellenbosch, he started his own business. In between coding for 20+ years professionally, he presented various courses and workshops over the years, including the Java Master courses of JavaSpecialists.eu; mostly so he can learn interesting stuff. More recently he discovered microservices, reactive programming and serverless, and heâ€™s been having a lot of fun with it.
