A developer who thrives on mentoring his peers, Ian’s successfully helped build a number of mobile apps in a remarkably short space of time. With a core skill-set including JavaScript, react-native, Automation, AWS, Fastlane, React, iOS and android native wrappers for react-native amongst others Ian is a highly versatile developer and practical guy with an ability to learn rapidly. When he’s not coding you’ll likely find him rock climbing, building things (with his hands) or snowboarding.
