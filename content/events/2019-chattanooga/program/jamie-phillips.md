This is an idea that came up when discussing that we need to shed the thinking that deployments donâ€™t need to occur on a Friday. I agree they do not, and we started discussing the increased risk of coupling deployments with releases. At a very high level I want to introduce the concept of orthogonality between deployments and releases while highlighting techniques like ring deployments, feature flags, and canary releases.
