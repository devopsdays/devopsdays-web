Can you truly know yourself? Can you even measure your own potential? In the age of nano degrees, bootcamps and self teaching, tech professionals new and old are experiencing imposter syndrome more than ever before. This talk is a reflection on my experience working as a developer, instructor, and independent filmmaker to bring to light practical advice for facing and overcoming self-doubt.
