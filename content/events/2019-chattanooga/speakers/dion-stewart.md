Dion Stewart is a coach, mentor, developer, and international speaker. He helps organizations improve their product delivery, addressing practices from product discovery through DevOps. For the last few years he has helped organizations create product development dojos and leads “project to product” transformations, often combining the two. As a Smalltalk developer, he was first exposed to the values, principles, and practices that were eventually codified into the Extreme Programming methodology in the late 1990s. He’s been learning better ways of building digital products and helping organizations improve their product delivery ever since. He enjoys working in situations where he is able to combine his interests in learning models, organizational change, and product development. Outside of work, Dion enjoys playing and recording music, meditation, and tai chi. For more information, visit dojoandco.com.
