I was born and raised in Chattanooga, but decided to go away to college. I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math science from Columbia University in May of 2018. After choosing happiness, peace of mind etc. by not taking the physics GRE to attend to grad school, I stumbled into data science at FreightWaves and have worked there since.
