Adam is a high energy, passionate early adopter of many things IT. He loves to help his team, and others at MediaMath, see the vision of the future and get them excited about where we’re heading. He believes in what DevOps and SRE can do for a world class technology company!.

Adam has 20 years of experience in web application development, and he has spent the last two deeply involved in application support. Adam now leads a team of incredible SREs and couldn't be happier!

Outside of work, he suffers from ‘Multiple Hobby Syndrome’ — much to his wife’s dismay — and enjoys brewing his own beer, hunting and the outdoors, singing with the Sound of Illinois barbershop chorus and his Barbershop Quartet. Adam’s family includes his Wife (mentioned above), 8 year old son, and 2 year old twins.
