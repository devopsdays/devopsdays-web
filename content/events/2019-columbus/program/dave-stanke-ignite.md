Ops people – even DevOps people! – and product managers don’t always see eye-to-eye. (You want how many nines?!?) In my 20+ year career, I’ve been a sysadmin, a product manager, and everything in between. In this talk, I’ll call out some of the tensions between these groups, and propose some techniques for working together toward common goals. There will be lots of snark about how product people are awful, sugarcoated with some touchy-feely stuff about how to make peace. But mostly: Let’s face it, we’re awful, too.
