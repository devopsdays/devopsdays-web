If you’re like 70% of continuous integration and delivery users out there, you’re using Jenkins, the powerful and popular automation server. Jenkins runs on many different operating systems, and can build and deploy applications in a variety of languages, across many different platforms. Almost no matter where you are in your automation maturity, there’s always another level to reach: if you’re using the basic point-and-click of freestyle jobs, you can move to the scripted context of pipelines. Once you’ve explored pipelines, you can learn to leverage shared global libraries to promote code reuse across multiple pipelines. In this session, you’ll learn basics about Jenkins, specific use cases for different job types, and how best to manage your automation as it grows from one job, to ten, to one hundred. Finally, you’ll learn how to create your entire Jenkins job collection from scratch, at the push of a button.
