It’s no secret that SysAdmins, DevOps Engineers, SRE’s, and many others in technology aren’t the best marketers of themselves. This is most prominent with the most experienced ones. Now that DevOps is upsetting the apple cart with SysAdmins, they need to be reminded of the fundamentals of interviewing. Those same fundamentals apply to even the most novice of candidates.
