Title = "Trusting Your Ingredients - What Building Software And Cheesecake Have In Common"

As a developer, I always thought that security, like documentation, would be done by someone else. While that might have been true in the past, in today’s world that model no longer works. As a developer you’re responsible for the security of your app. Security in this case should be seen in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from licenses to software packages. A chef creating cheesecake has similar challenges. The ingredients of a cheesecake are similar to the software packages a developer uses. The preparation is similar to the DevOps pipeline, and recipe is similar to the licenses for developers. Messing up any of those means you have a messy kitchen, or a data breach!

In this talk we’ll look at:

* Why do we care about licenses?
* How does Sec get into the early stages of DevSecOps?
* What can chefs and devs learn from each other?
