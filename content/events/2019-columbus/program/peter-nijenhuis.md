A lot of companies have a vision and mission statement and in addition to that, they also have company core values. However most companies are forgetting a very important next step. Translate those core values into concrete behaviours. When you’re not making these values more tangible, it can stay fuzzy for your colleagues. Because everyone has his own beliefs and values and therefore a slightly different perspective when it comes to a value and therefore shows different behaviours. That’s the reason you have to make it concrete and tangible, because then everybody is on the same page and you’ve created an environment where people can provide feedback to each other because now everybody knows exactly what the other person means and expects.
