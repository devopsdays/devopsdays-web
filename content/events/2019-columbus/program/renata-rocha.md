The purpose is to explain quickly what Kubernetes does best, itâ€™s major issues, understand how it became so popular so fast and ensure you make an informed decision about whether you should be using it as your solution or not. K8S is a complex and powerful tool, and like any other devops tools it has pros and cons, and those have to be pondered before a team commits to a migration.
