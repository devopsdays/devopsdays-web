I am currently the Vice President of Digital Platform Engineering at Nike. My teams are accountable for building a re-usable seamless platform to power Nike Direct to Consumer experiences. I am leading the teams accountable for core commerce services (browse, search, checkout, payment, launch, inventory, fulfillment), user services (login, profile, identity, notifications), consumer data engineering, content ecosystem (authoring, creation, digital assets, workflow) member services and global retail solutions. Prior to that, I was the VP of Retail Technology at Starbucks. I was accountable for the global POS and retail store technology experiences. Prior to Starbucks, I spent 14 years at Nordstrom with my last role being the Vice President of E-Commerce and Store technologies where I drove a technological transformation essential for outpacing the demands of today's Omnichannel consumers. I was accountable for program management, delivery, and support for all customer facing technologies including in-store, Web, and mobile touch points. I joined Nordstrom as a security engineer in 2002 and held a variety of leadership roles across the technology organization. I am a graduate of Eastern Washington University with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems and worked at two startups, CyberSafe and WorldStream Communications, prior to joining Nordstrom.
