Devops - Sysadmin  - Automation enthusiast - AWS addicted - Optimized for Cats!

I started dabbling with computers in the late 80s with a ZX Spectrum clone. It was love at the first command line and having control over my computing units has always been a must for me. My first contact with Linux happened when I was in Math  school, in the late 90s, and it's been almost 20 years since I last had a computer running something that wasn't *nix based.

I moved from Unix Systems Admin to Devops about 10 years ago and I haven't looked back. I love monitoring, automation, and the computing power the cloud offers me.  Cloud Platforms like AWS are my personal playground.

On my free time I like to play with my cats,  listen to Joy Division, ride my bikes or just take ballet lessons at the National Ballet of Canada. Wait, have I tried to explain how ballet exercises are EXACTLY like programming...?
