**Ignite Talk**

In this presentation, Kasper will be presenting Lunar Way's perspective on a Cloud Native CI/CD solution using GitOps as the driver and motivation. GitOps was coined by Weaveworks, as a way to use developer tooling to drive operations, and use git as the source of truth. We will look at the reasons for going down this path and how it fits with a Cloud Native setup.
