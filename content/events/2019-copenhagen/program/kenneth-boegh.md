**Ignite talk**

Uber has been doing DevOps since it hired its first developer back in 2009, and has grown to a scale where it now has 1000's of developers, making 1000's of changes to 1000's of micro-services in production, every day.

In this talk, Kenneth will give a virtual lightning tour of Ubers DevOps stack showing how it's wired together, how so many changes are made in a safe way and that you might not have to build it all from scratch if you also want to scale to thousands.
