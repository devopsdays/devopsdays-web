Home automation is increasingly popular. However, the one thing that is often overlooked with current solutions is their complete lack of attention to high availability: Typically a failure of your automation hub quickly renders an elegant smart home into an ordinary dumb home.

In the pursuit of building a reliable smart home, we will investigate ways to make the open-source automation platform "home-assistant" highly available by applying Kubernetes to a not quite standard problem. Some might call it over-engineering, others might call it thorough engineering. In any case, by the end of this talk, we will have explored a more exotic use case for Kubernetes.
