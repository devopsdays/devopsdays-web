Transgender, ex-cage fighter, developer, DevOps goddess ;) I was terrified of being on stage in 2017, in 2018 I found my flow and I really put my self out there, also published a chapter in a book. I love dev, movies, my two cats, my girlfriend, creating awesome environments without the bullshit and enabling engineers to really do what they love.
