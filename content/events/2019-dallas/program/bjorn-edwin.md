##### TALK ABSTRACT

Target, Verizon, Capital One, Walmart and other giant enterprises have been creating Dojos (immersive learning environments) to facilitate their DevOps adoption. Today, DevOps Dojos may be the best way to help your organization in its journey towards doing DevOps the right way. The DevOps Dojos we have created for our enterprise clients have enabled them to accelerate their software delivery. Based on these experiences, we would like to share how you can start a successful Dojo in 8 simple steps. These steps are industry, domain and technology agnostic.

If you are a leader, manager or engineer who is passionate about bringing the Dojo concept to your organization, this talk will give you the 8 steps you need to follow to design, build and grow your own DevOps Dojo.

The 8 steps are as follows:

* Assess the current state of DevOps tools and pipelines.
* Identify and build the first and most common delivery pipeline and create a plan for the remaining pipelines.
* Determine types of masters, types of coaches and physical space needs.
* Adjust teams, players and technical practices as needed.
* Design schedules, timelines, curriculum topics, labs and activities.
* Make Dojo delivery and execution fun so learning becomes both rewarding and inevitable.
* Share ongoing support and updates.
* Grow in-house expertise, community and events. Bonus: Typical challenges you may face and how to avoid them
