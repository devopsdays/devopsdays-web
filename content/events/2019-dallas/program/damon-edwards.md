##### TALK ABSTRACT

Some DevOps transformations flourish, but others are stalling. Why is that? This talk will make the case that Operations is the most predictable differentiator.
<br><br>
So much of the energy in DevOps has been about activities that start in Dev and move towards Ops — continuous delivery, deployment pipelines, automated testing, and of course, the unofficial mantra of “deploy, deploy, deploy. “However, post-deployment, too many DevOps transformations maintain the status quo and leave questionable Operations practices in place.
<br><br>
Now along comes a new vision for Operations called SRE (a.k.a. Site Reliability Engineering)… But SRE seems almost too good to be true!
<br><br>
SREs are cover much of what systems administrators used to do, but get to spend most of their time doing engineering work that adds enduring value to their company? How is it that SREs’ don’t get caught up in the interruptions, repetitive work, and drudgery that consumes so much of our time? And how do companies use SRE to do so much more with the same or less headcount?
<br><br>
This talk will take a close look at what SRE is, what SRE isn’t, and how SRE avoids the pitfalls that have plagued traditional Ops work. Finally, we’ll break down the principles behind the SRE movement and highlight how early examples are proving that DevOps + SRE = the end-to-end speed and quality promised since the early days of DevOps.
