##### TALK ABSTRACT

DevOps requires a drastic shift from a traditional long-running project mindset. Best intentions can easily be thwarted simply because the new ways seem to go against the old way of thinking that teams and their managers hold so dearly.

The Chicken or the Egg? With so many changes in culture, mindset, and process involved in DevOps transformation, it can be difficult to see how outcomes will change without some hands-on context. But without changing the culture, mindset and process, there cannot be hands-on context.

In this talk, I’m going to temporarily set aside metrics and industry reports. I’ll use basic math to address some of the common arguments and anti-patterns I’ve seen.
