##### TALK ABSTRACT

Life is not easy. But it is up to us to build resilience that enables us to move forward in a graceful way. Attending to difficult feelings without becoming subsumed by them; we can develop an awareness of our bigger picture goals and accomplish tasks we never thought were possible.

Weâ€™ve been conditioned over the years to always question whether we can succeed. We tend to focus on all the things that could go wrong instead of the possibilities. The attitude of being ready to work even in the face of challenges and despite odds is what will make all the difference in your life. In this session, you will learn how changing your narrative and focusing on what is possible can have a dramatic effect on both your success at work and your happiness in life.
