I’ve been enamored with computers and technology since my father brought home an Amiga 1000. I spent 8 years working as a developer and architect in various roles, before moving into SRE. I’m in love with all things cloud and Kubernetes. I currently work remotely for Lumin Digital building a platform from the ground up, and loving every minute of it (well most anyways).
