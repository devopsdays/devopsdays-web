Dan spent 12 years in the military as a fighter jet mechanic before transitioning to a career in technology as a software engineer and then a manager.

He’s now leading RSA Archer as their Chief Architect in their cloud migration and conversion to SaaS. Dan is also an organizer of DevOps KC and the DevOpsDays KC conference.

I served in the Air Force for 12 years as an aircraft mechanic. That’s the guy who is covered in jet fuel, oil, hydraulic fluid, and works 16 hour days regularly. I’ve been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, and Qatar during war. I was nearly hit by a mortar in Iraq. I also lived in South Korea, Italy, and Germany.
