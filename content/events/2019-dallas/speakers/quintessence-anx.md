I have worked in the IT community for over 10 years, including as a database administrator and a DevOps / Cloud / Infrastructure engineer. I was also a core contributor to Stark & Wayneâ€™s SHIELD project, which adds backup functionality to Cloud Foundry, as well as a technical reviewer for Learning Go Programming published by Packt Publishing. Currently I am the US Developer Advocate for Logz.io, focusing community engagement related to DevOps. Outside of work I am a leader and co-founder of Inclusive Tech Buffalo to help underrepresented minorities in tech launch careers in development.
