The ultimate objective of a DevOps approach is to deliver quality products to your customers as efficiently as possible. DevOps shops that achieved this state point to continuous testing as a key contributor to their success. However, QA and testing have become forgotten orphans in the DevOps journey of many organizations. For groups that have incorporated testing, many have a release cadence that resembles something more like waterfall. The culprit is often the inability to incorporate stable automation into their testing practices.

In this talk, Lee will discuss how organizations can address these issues, and move towards continuous testing within their DevOps practices. Specifically, the discussion will touch on key practices and methods for implementing effective test automation in a DevOps pipeline including test suite & test scope, automation approach/methods, and test environment and data management.
