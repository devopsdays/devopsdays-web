The main premise of this talk is that the current state of DevOps tooling, is overly complex and too much of a cognitive load to be sustainable given current demands. I will provide a history of how we got here, and the rationale behind the choices that resulted in our current state. Then we will look at the future, and the needs of modern software development which conflict with our current practices.
