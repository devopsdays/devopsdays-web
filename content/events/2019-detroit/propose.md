# DevopsDays Detroit CFP closes July 30th, 2019
## What we’re looking this year

Types of Accepted Proposals

- Ignite Talks: 5-minute, auto-forwarding talk.
- Presentations: A 30-minute talk on a topic of your choice, with some time for questions.
- Open Spaces: 45-minute discussions driven by topics suggested by you! What attendees want to talk about.


The Ignite Talks are 5 minute talks with 20 slides (max., 15 seconds per slide) which auto-advance. If you are not familiar with the Ignite Talk format, good examples can be found at: http://ignitetalks.io/.


## Guidelines


- Use demos and examples to help tell a story (Show, don’t tell!)
- Multiple entries are welcome (maximum of 3 please)
- Submissions must be made by one of the presenters; we do not accept proposals submitted on behalf of others.
- All presentations must conform to the DevOpsDays code of conduct.


## Ideas


- What are the most powerful feedback loops in your organization? How do you measure their efficacy? (e.g., developers on call for their own applications)
- Have you implemented devops practices that radically changed your organization’s productivity? (e.g., we did $X and now we deploy to production 10,000 times per year)
- What kind of innovation is happening in your delivery pipeline? What have you automated that in prior years no one thought could be automated?
- How has machine learning or artificial intelligence changed workflows in your devops approach?
- How have you solved security control testing in your organization? How has security influenced your organizational culture?
- Do you run stateful applications that incorporate continuous deployment practices or are deployed in a containerized environment? How do you handle data durability, security, backups, and other aspects?
- Does your organization practice modern quality assurance methods like chaos or other stress testing methods through continuous integration and deployment processes or other avenues?
- Has container technology risen above the hype in your organization? Tell us about your experience.
- What leadership hacks made your team(s) more effective this year? (team org, roles, new specializations, etc)

## Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:


- Broad appeal: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- New local presenters: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes in the Metro Detroit area. 
- Underrepresented voices: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you’re in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you’re in a large, traditional organization, or you’re the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- Original content: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn’t likely to have already seen.
- No third-party submissions. This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. 
- No vendor pitches: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product. You can demo at your table or during Open Spaces. But if you want to share about how your team solved problems to build or host your product at scale, we want to hear about that. 
- Open Space Fodder: Will this talk help generate discussion in the Open Spaces?
