Daniel Sauble is a Product Manager at npm, the company behind the worldâ€™s most popular package registry. He spends a lot of time thinking about the security of the open-source ecosystem and how to empower developers to make good security decisions. Prior to npm, Daniel worked in the package management space at Sonatype as a Product Owner and UX Developer, and prior to that, he worked in the configuration management space at Puppet as a UX Designer and Software Developer. Working in agile startups has really impacted the way he thinks about how work ought to be done: quickly, iteratively, and without ego.

Daniel lives in beautiful Portland, Oregon, USA, where he enjoys running ultramarathons, writing software and blog posts, and learning data science in his spare time. His kids have other opinions about how this spare time should be spent, which is doing wonders for his time management skills.
