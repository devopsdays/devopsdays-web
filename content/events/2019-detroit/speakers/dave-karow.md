As Evangelist at Split Software, Dave speaks about feature flag strategies that connect progressive feature delivery with per-session observation of system health, user experience and user behavior. Dave grew up in Silicon Valley as it evolved from chips to software and then internet services, giving him a unique perspective on the long arc of technology evolution. Before joining Split, Dave evangelized the “shift left” of performance testing at BlazeMeter, helping dev teams ship faster with greater confidence.
