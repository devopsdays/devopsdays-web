At Sky Betting and Gaming we've been on a DevOps journey since 2011. We've undertaken numerous "DevOps Transformations" and learned that this is an ongoing program rather than a "Big Bang" initiative. As the company has restructured in to agile autonomous tribes and squads, we've identified and reused a number of patterns and techniques as we've evolved our ways of working. This talk aims to share those learnings.
