Why the most of DevOps transformations fail? What’s wrong with DevOps?
We tend to focus on transformation itself a lot, instead of solving a real business problem. As stated in Conway’s law organisations tend to produce designs/software which are copies of the communication structures of these organisations. In other words, how we are organised is an important part of any transformation. Also in order to make progress with your transformation you need to know what you are comparing against and what are your measures of success. In this talk I would like to share on how your organisation can benefit from introducing DevOps as a mindset and how as a leader you can coach and support your team to enable it.
