I'm a DevOps engineer / architect who's been working for Chef for the past 3+ years. Husband. Father. Dog owner. Technology enthusiast. PC Gamer.

I've held many roles in my time in IT from a helpdesk agent to technical lead of a team managing applications with tens of millions of users. I now hold a lead role at Chef, and had stops everywhere in between including government contracting and startups.
