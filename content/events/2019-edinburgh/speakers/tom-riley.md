I am a Platform Engineer working in Manchester who is passionate about all things Cloud, in particular the monitoring and observability of infrastructure and services. I have spent the last two years working with Kubernetes and containerisation and I absolutely love learning about new things, which happens pretty often when working with Kubernetes!
I am also a co-organiser of Cloud Native + Kubernetes Manchester and have spoken at several local tech meet-ups in Manchester. I really enjoy talking about my learnings working with Kubernetes, monitoring and observability. I am looking to speak at conferences to share with the wider community and also develop my skills in this space!
