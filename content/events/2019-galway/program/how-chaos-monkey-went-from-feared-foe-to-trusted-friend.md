Our talk will be about our transition from a start-up where there was little or no SRE practises to when acquired by Genesys and what SRE best practices they brought to the table. We want to talk about the lessons  we learned as a group through Chaos Engineering and how we were able to integrate our services and become part of resilient cloud platform. We also want to talk about our thinking on the matter and how we went about achieving this.
