Eoin Nugent works on developer tooling and test infrastructure at Stripe in Dublin. He helps make building and testing quick, reliable, and intuitive, so Stripes can be as productive as possible.

Prior to moving to Dublin, Eoin worked on Stripe’s developer platform, focusing on improving the experience of developers integrating with Stripe’s API — for example, he helped redesign Stripe’s API reference documentation pages. Before all this, he worked on internationalization and growth at Yelp.

Eoin delights in questioning assumptions and improving the experience for users outside of the “happy path”, whether that’s developers dealing with unexpected test failures or external users in foreign markets.
