Michele Pegoraro worked in software lifecycle management as a consultant for many clients across Europe in the last 12 years, helping them to design and develop processes for software configuration, build and release management. He’s currently Head of DevOps for IBM Cúram Social Program Management. He is a strong Agile supporter and embraced DevOps as part of that journey. When he's not trying to automate the entire world, he's a gamer, a wanna-be photographer, and a quite bad golfer.
