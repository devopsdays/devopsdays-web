#### Speaker

Pierre is originally from a Software Development background and the rise of DevOps drove him to become more involved in how systems actually run in the real-world, and how he could make a difference helping others care about the applications they release to production.

He is currently Infrastructure & Reliability Manager at Poppulo, where he's responsible for their continuous delivery platform and the operations of their hybrid on-prem/cloud infrastructure.
