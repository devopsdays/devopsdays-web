Ríona is senior staff technical writer at Google, where she manages the Google Cloud Platform documentation team focused on CI/CD. In her 12 years at Google, she also drove efforts around open source documentation strategy, and previously led the team that builds g3doc, Google's internal platform for engineering documentation, used by thousands of projects within the company. Before Google, she worked at Amazon and spent almost 10 years as a writer, editor, and program manager at Microsoft. She is a frequent speaker on documentation, diversity, and inclusion. As a graduate of NUIG, she is happy to be back in Galway, and will not rest until documentation is fully integrated into engineering culture and workflow.
