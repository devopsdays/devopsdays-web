<h3>Join the community</h3>
devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.

    <td>Whom should we send?</td>
    <td>Most attendees engage best when discussions can range from specific products/tools <b>AND</b> general technology in the same space in additional to changing/improving culture from different perspectives and levels. This doesn't mean you should limit your representatives to only those directly involved in developing your products, only that limiting the focus to your products and it's capabilities is unlikely to offer insight into any wider discussions and consequently lack engagement from attendees. If you are looking for a guideline, those that can get involved in an open discussion on the problem areas your products solve and would be willing to put forward a topic for an open space.</td>
