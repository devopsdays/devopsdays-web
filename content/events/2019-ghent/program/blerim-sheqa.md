When the term Observability came up we were all told that we don't have to care about our systems anymore. We should move all of our infrastructure to the cloud, into containers and finally serverless will solve not only all our monitoring issues but all other things as well. Reality shows that this is not the case for most of us. While the importance of observability is given, we should not forget about everything we learned to make our monitoring suck less.
