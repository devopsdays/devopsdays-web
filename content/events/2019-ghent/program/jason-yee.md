Creating and delivering a good talk talk is difficult. Like many other crafts, it requires a combination of skill and style—both of which are honed through practice. In this ignite, I’ll share what I’ve learned about writing and delivering compelling ignite talks at dozens of DevOpsDays around the world. I’ll also touch on why ignites are so valuable to DevOpsDays and lessons we can apply to DevOps.
