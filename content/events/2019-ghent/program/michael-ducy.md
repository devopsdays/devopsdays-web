We’ve all taken different paths to get to be here at this conference, but in the end we are all here at “the same place.” This talk will cover some personal journeys of those in our industry to help us all better understand what it took for those people to get here today. The goal of this talk is to help us understand that not everyone’s journey was like ours and provide the opportunity for us to exercise empathy for each other. Empathy has long been a focal point of DevOps, but it often focuses on the nature of our work & it’s relationship to our lives. True empathy is understanding the whole individual and finding common understanding in our paths. Hopefully attendees will leave with a better appreciation of their fellow humans, and better appreciation of their own journey that brought them here today.
