After switching many different roles over the past years , I've been running my own business over the past 5 years.

Given my background, "doing" devops I assumed would be the least of my worries. I wanted to learn how devops could make a difference on business level.

This talk is an experience report on my learnings:

- Devops is not so special in a company context
- Decisions made in other departements impact devops and vice-versa
- How to improve relationships/feedback beyond dev & ops
- Optimize for the whole system , not just the part between dev and ops

p.s. by other departements I don't mean devsecops , but parts like sales, marketing, legal, hr, finance ... To infinity and beyond !
