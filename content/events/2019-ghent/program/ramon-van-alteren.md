As product manager for compute, storage and network capacity delivery for Spotify world-wide, procurement of that capacity was one of the major products, especially timely procurement of capacity to cope with on-going global growth.

During this talk I'll share experience on how we build a multi-functional team responsible for buying datacenter space, network/storage/compute capacity that incorporated legal, finance, engineering and commercial aspects of procurement. And how the mission of that team changed when Spotify moved to Google Cloud Platform.
