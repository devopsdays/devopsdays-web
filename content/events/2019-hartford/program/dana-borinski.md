Our customers need branded URL in order to support their brand and increase click-through rate.
The world is becoming secured and HTTPS is a must.
Since there is no out of the box solution we had to build our own.
In order to implement SSL for your customers, a complicated security process is needed involving different organizations units for both the client and us.
This is how we solved the problem with Letsencrypt, docker, Redis, Nginx, resty-Lua and autossl module.
