You fear your code. Once in production, you are afraid of changing it. A bug? You fix it using messy, yet surgical, hacks, rather than a refactoring that leaves your code better.

Admit it! You fear your code. But there's a way out: just write tests. Writing tests is impossible! It makes my productivity tank! My boss doesnâ€™t leave me any time for writing tests!

These are all excuses for not writing tests. I will show you techniques that will force you to write those tests, and I will show you how they help you sleep better at night, make you more productive, and make you a much better developer.
