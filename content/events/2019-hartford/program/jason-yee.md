As applications become more distributed and complex, so do our failure modes. In this presentation, I’ll share why you shouldn’t just embrace failure, but why you should induce it to intentionally cause and learn from failure.

This presentation will start with some basic information on why you should start running Chaos experiments (sometimes called Game Days), how we run them at Datadog, and how to start implementing them within your organization.

We’ll then get hands on and run a Chaos experiment—breaking a sample application and investigating the results to learn more about how systems and applications work.
