Tinkering, building and breaking stuff since I was 10 years. I've built several independent projects and filled several positions in which I met the DevOps field in many strange ways, until I finally became an Infrastructure Engineer at monday.com about a year ago, and am meeting new challenges every day.

Strong believer in knowledge sharing through blog posts, meetups and conferences, and never miss the opportunity to attend a good professional gathering. I also consider myself a good public speaker, and I feel that it's finally my time to give back and share others in the local tech community with my experiences.
