I’m coding since 4th grade when my dad taught me BASIC, and I got hooked. From that point, I learned to code in many programming languages (today my favorite is C#). Today I’m working at Soluto by Asurion, and coding is a huge part of my day job.
My passion for AppSec started by accident when I was offered the role of security champion. The AppSec journey was (and still is) fascinated, and taught me a lot. OWASP helped me a lot during this journey; This is why I decided to become a paying member and also leading OWASP Glue.
My current job is DevSecOps – helping the entire team to produce more secure software. Besides my job, I’m also giving a lot of talks all over the world, and heavy OSS contributor – mainly to Kamus, a secret encryption solution for Kubernetes platform.
When I’m not working – I’m enjoying the company of my two beloved kids
