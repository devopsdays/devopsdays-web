I’ve been in IBM Systems Assurance for over 16 years now, specifically in the Power Hardware Systems Test area. I’ve held multiple roles in the organization, from test engineer to team lead to release manager. In more recent years, my focus has been on improving the test organization through better tooling and automation, pioneering DevOps and Agile along the way. I am now the Tools and Automation Architect for all of Systems Assurance, including Power, Z Systems, and Storage Solutions. My current role emphasizes collaboration in our automation efforts across the organization, bringing in new skills and expertise, and focusing on emerging technologies such as ML and Data Analytics.
