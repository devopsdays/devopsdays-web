Title = "From New Cluster to Insight: Deploying Monitoring and Logging to Kubernetes"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["eddie-zaneski"]

In this workshop we'll utilize open source tools like Prometheus, Helm, Grafana, and Loki to quickly go from being in the dark to having full visibility into the happenings of our clusters and workloads. We'll deploy an entire monitoring and logging stack to a fresh cluster and hunt down a bug.
