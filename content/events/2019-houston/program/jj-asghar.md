You see this cloud-native thing creep into some conversations. You are starting to see your boss reading this Kubernetes book. You’ve googled around about both, but all the terms and technology is hard to grasp. Luckily this talk I’ll walk through in 20 slides everything you need to know about Kubernetes to be dangerous. From there you can take it and focus on what you need to know and start discovering it for yourself.
