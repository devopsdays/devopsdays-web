Is your organization suffering from "Over the Wall Ops?" The road to production is fraught with danger and risks, learn how Endurance is tackling the problem, lowering risk, and speeding up launches by having Development and Operations work hand in hand leveraging OpenShift! Join us for a real-world case study from both sides, Shaun Ladewig (System Architect) presents lessons learned in understanding, deploying, and managing an OpenShift cluster while Robert Stone (Principal Software Engineer) outlines how that cluster is used to stand up, deploy, and re-tool our monoliths to fit a more container-based architecture.
