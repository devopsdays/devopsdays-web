I am a Senior Software Architect at Kublr with vast experience working with many different technology platforms. Working with Kubernetes since 2016, I am a certified Kubernetes administrator and author of cluster autoscaler support for Azure (based on VMSS). I have worked as a software architect for more than 13 years and live and breathe all things Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services (AWS), agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) and am versed in DevOps languages: Go lang, Java/Scala, bash, Javascript/TypeScript. I have worked extensively on cloud-native environments and have broad experience developing distributed systems, containerizing legacy systems and implementing several serverless projects on AWS.
