* "Yea, but we don’t have time"
* "Yea, but that won’t work here"
* "Yea, but not right now"
* "Yea, but our business partners are not ready for that"

We have all heard these before! Lets be honest, we have given up because
of them! Just picture that manager or director standing there with that
concerned face, trying their best to give the “I agree” look, but you
know they have already decided to be dismissive of your idea! I think
its hilarious how they reach in to their bag of excuses and just hand
one out!

This is so frustrating, and I want to help you with some quick
responses, and some warnings. Over passion for your idea can work
against you! Lets explore this situation we face every day as parts of
the DevOps community!
