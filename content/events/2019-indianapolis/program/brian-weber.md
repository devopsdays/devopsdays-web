How do you ensure that your newly deserved service is stable, reliable,
and maintainable, prior to rolling to production? What about services
that are already in production? Are there ways you and your team could
prevent major outages in advance of critical outages and late-night
pagers? Well-defined and calmly enforced standards can prevent and fix
both major and minor outages. The enforcement of preventative measures
go back through numerous concepts and industries, preventing countless
major incidents. Defensive measures translate into saving of lives,
resources, and money. This is no different for the tech industry, and
this is often the bread and butter of engineers in the DevOps space.
This talk will review several standard patterns that we use at Twitter
to define and manage standards. Pre-production standards ensure
stability, visibility, and manageability. Post-production standards
revise already-productionized services. You too can come up with a
method for implementing standards that prevent and mitigate countless
outages, fixing issues before they happen.
