One of the most difficult questions that teams need to answer is: “Why
are we doing x when we could be doing y?” Tooling and process decisions
are highly influential, often come with a high degree of user bias, and
yet can be among the worst documented decisions that organizations make.

The Hesburgh Libraries at the University of Notre Dame have increasingly
been moving towards the DevOps culture, working on rapidly delivering
solutions and granting systems engineers and developers both the freedom
to solve problems. An impetus for this culture shift was a University
and organizational mandate to adopt a “CloudFirst” mentality, embracing
Software-as-a-Service solutions whenever possible, and moving onto
Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service where needed.

A consistent concern from the technologists has been having a consistent
answer to the question: “What tool(s) should we use to do this work”?
Having a shared understanding of tooling creates a shared context of
workflow, pain points, and success stories. A shared understanding of
tooling also suggests that work is transferrable and has some resilience
against personnel churn.

This is not a talk about the tools themselves - rather, this is a talk
providing insight into how tooling decisions can be made, and made in a
sustainable and productive way. The Hesburgh Libraries have been working
towards a culture of contributor empowerment for decisions - which can
certainly have impacts to shared understanding of problems and isolated
decisions. Hear how we attempt to balance the agility of individual
empowerment with the need for institutional resilience.

Ian Alford joined the Hesburgh Libraries as the manager for the
Enterprise Systems Unit in January of 2017. His portfolio functional
responsibility for service delivery, infrastructure, security, and
availability of both internal and patron-facing Library services. In
addition, his team holds Quality Assurance and testing as functional
responsibilities.
