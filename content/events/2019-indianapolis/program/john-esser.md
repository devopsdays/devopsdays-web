Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) originated at Google as a discipline
and set of practices to operationalize and scale its services. An SRE
values, skills, and approaches does not reflect the typical SysAdmin
role so making the shift to SRE is a challenge and a transformation in
and of itself. Having built an SRE organization from the ground up, I
will outline how to morph an existing operations group to an SRE
discipline, the typical challenges of doing so, explain the top SRE
practices (e.g. eliminate toil) teams can and should adopt to scale
their services, and the mindset needed to effectively work with the
developers in the organization. SRE is not operations as usual!
