I have a more elaborate vision for DevOps. I define it as a culture
where a diverse set of identities, genders, roles, educations, and
techniques work together to ensure a balanced and focused perspective
for team, product, and users. I hear this term often used when referring
to only technical roles, but this version includes marketing, UX,
design, and sales.

I’ll walk through the story of SnapCI, a now defunct continuous delivery
tool, the unconscious silos the team built, how we broke them down, and
one of the biggest mistakes me made when developing a new feature. I’ll
also fast forward to how we built on those lessons learned and
relentlessly worked towards improving our culture.
