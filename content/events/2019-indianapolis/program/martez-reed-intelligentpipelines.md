A deployment pipeline often consists of a Jenkins pipeline and a few
commands to deploy a service. The problem with this is that most
pipelines lack the intelligence necessary to make decisions based upon
real-time data being generated.

The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how
a deployment pipeline can become more intelligent. The talk will walk
through some of the following areas.

* Whatâ€™s missing from my current pipeline?
* Where does the data live?
* How do you integrate that data with a deployment pipeline?
* How do you generate data using load testing, chaos engineering and more?
* How do you make decisions based upon real-time data?

At the conclusion of the session attendees should walk away with ideas
of how to extend existing CI/CD pipelines or deployment pipelines to
take advantage of additional logic using real-time data.
