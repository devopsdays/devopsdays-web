The practice of engineering the processes of a development effort are
often ad hoc. While that can clearly work well for trivial things, it
tends to be under-clubbed for larger efforts. Likewise, intense process
with constant updates and schedules is equally impossible to deal with.
This talk deals with something of the happy medium but leaning far more
towards enterprise efforts and the results that are usually expected of
that. We’ll talk about and demonstrate elements of a consistent build
lifecycle and why you need one, and discuss what happens when you don’t.
