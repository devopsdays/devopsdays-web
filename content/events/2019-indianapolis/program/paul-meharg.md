Software development is pressed for faster and faster release cycles
with acceptable quality, budget and security. As movements like CI, CD
and Devops aim to cut down on release cycles, it’s security’s job to
help control the risk. The risk landscape is complex as modern
development practices increasingly consume more and more third-party
code. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore - it’s time for
DevSecOps. This session gives an overview of how companies have
implemented DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines and how
this can help increase developer awareness of risks affecting them.
We’ll walk an example CICD Pipeline and explore how security has been
embedded as a part of it, how the movement is shaping up and how
standards are starting to follow suite.
