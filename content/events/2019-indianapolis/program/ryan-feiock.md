I was recently reading the book Space Barons which discusses the
privatized space race, and it points out how Blue Origin takes on an
outward appearance of slow and steady. In the book they mention the
company’s unofficial motto of “slow is smooth, smooth is fast”.

That statement resonated with me in that my DevOps career has been
focused on strategic planning, careful implementation, and then once the
framework is in place, stepping on the gas. This concept can be applied
to a number of DevOps components, whether it is a generic CI framework
that lets you rapidly add new products and features, or planning out
your cloud strategy so you are able to scale quickly and address needs
geographically.

This talk will focus on the idea that sometimes we need to slow down and
build things properly so that we can hit that stride later on when it
matters.
