I’ll introduce “the apocalypse matrix,” which has a severity axis (mild
to severe) and a locality axis (personal to global). Preparing for a
major global apocalypse (zombies) happens to also prepare you for a mild
local apocalypse (iced into your house with no power for several days).
Pivoting this concept to an IT apocalypse will help us come up with
plans for incident responses and pack our metaphorical bug out bags.
