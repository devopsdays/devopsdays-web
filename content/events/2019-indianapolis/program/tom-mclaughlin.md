Title = "Serverless DevOps: What do we do when the server goes away?"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["tom-mclaughlin"]
+++

With the rise of serverless architecture, many of the common day-to-day
operations tasks will change dramatically, if not disappear completely.
We as operations professionals will be challenged to redefine our roles
and responsibilities within the technology organization as serverless
abstracts away the server and its respective OS to cloud service
providers. In order to redefine our role, we must first understand how
serverless adoption effects our organizations as well as understand the
value of our work as seen by the eyes of our employers.

This is not a serverless tech talk! The talk focuses on understanding
how technical change affects our role as operations engineers. We’re
talking about how a tool like serverless will affect people and process
in your organization. We cover these ideas through the shift to
serverless but the themes and ideas are applicable even to those just
making the leap from on-prem to public cloud.

This talk will cover:

* What is this thing we call serverless?
* The impact of its adoption by your organization on your operations role.
* Engineering team realignment (how to get rid of your ops team but retain your ops people).
* The new operations role and responsibilities.
* Becoming more connected to the business needs of your organization.
* Building products and not projects for your user.

The audience should come away with a better understanding of their value
as operations engineers, how to demonstrate it, and how to respond to
technical change in their organization as they see technology or their
cloud provider assuming more of their role’s responsibilities.
