leads a team that is charged with leading the DevOps Transformation
across his IT organization

Outside of work, he suffers from 'Multiple Hobby Syndrome' — much to his
wife’s dismay — and enjoys brewing his own beer, hunting and the
outdoors, singing with the Sound of Illinois barbershop chorus and his
Barbershop Quartet. Adam’s family includes his Wife (mentioned above), 8
year old son, and 2 year old twins.
