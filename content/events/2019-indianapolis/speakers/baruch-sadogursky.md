Baruch’s passion is speaking about technology. Well, speaking in
general, but doing it about technology makes him look smart, and 17
years of hi-tech experience sure helps. When he’s not on stage (or on a
plane to get there), he learns about technology, people and how they
work, or more precisely, don’t work together.

Baruch is a Head of DevRel and a Developer Advocate at JFrog, a CNCF
Ambassador, a passionate conference speaker on DevOps, Java and Groovy
topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events
including JavaOne (where he was awarded a Rock Star award), DockerCon,
Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon and many others. Follow him on Twitter
(as he’s a very entertaining guy!) at @jbaruch.
