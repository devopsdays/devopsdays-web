Hi! My name is Brian, and I’m an SRE at Twitter. My pronouns are he/him.
I support the direct messaging product and our platform security team,
where I work on improving the stability and security of numerous backend
services, as well as improve build and deploy procedures for those teams
as well. Python is my programming language of choice.

In my off hours, I enjoy skiing on the snow, off-roading on the dirt,
and kayaking on the water. I’m also into knitting with wool yarn and
making delicous food with lots of interesting ingredients. I’m a
husband, and a father, and a mentor. I love teaching as much as I love
learning and try to do both whenever I can.
