My career has spanned almost two decades, working in the internet
industry on both agency and product sides. I started as an analyst and
strategist, eventually starting my own marketing agency to help
locally-owned and sustainable businesses stay competitive.

As a ThoughtWorker, I run marketing for both GoCD. I've been able to
make real impact through this role and excited to provide a great place
for people to learn about CD with our tools and through best practices.

Oh, and I'm a triathlete
