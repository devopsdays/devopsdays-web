I'm a Sales Engineer specializing in DevOps and Software Delivery
Automation for the past 10 years. Prior to Sonatype, I was with IBM
working with the UrbanCode (DevOps) family of products, and prior to IBM
I worked with Red Hat, Hewlett Packard, and Texas Instruments. I seek
to understand clients requirements and to craft solutions meeting those
needs. I have worked closely with customers across a variety of
industries in the United States and Canada. I bring over 25 years of
experience in the software industry as a developer, software tester,
sales engineer, consultant and business development manager. I have a
Computer Science degree from Texas State University. I'm married with
two grown daughters who have started their own families!  My hobbies
include camping and hiking, photography, and playing with Raspberry Pi
computers.
