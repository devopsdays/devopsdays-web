Ramin has spent the last five years working with data teams and large
enterprises to put machine learning, a/b testing, and data science
products into production. Heâ€™s made ALL the mistakes and then some,
helping companies lose thousands, if not millions, of dollars along the
way. He is currently based in Seattle and spends his time working on
adversarial experimentation tools that target infrastructure and release
artifacts to help teams inspect and learn about their software AFTER it
has been baked and released.
