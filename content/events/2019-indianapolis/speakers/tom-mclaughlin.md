Tom is the founder of [ServerlessOps](https://www.serverlessops.io) and
an experienced operations engineer. He started ServerlessOps after he
asked the question, what would he do if servers went away? At a loss for
an answer and interested in the future of his profession, he decided to
pursue the answer. Tom is actively engaged in promoting serverless
infrastructure and engaging with the community to learn more about their
thoughts, wants, and concerns are around the topic.

Previously, Tom has worked in Engineering and Developer Relations. As an
engineer he enjoyed building automation tools and platform automation
infrastructure. His goal was to ensure that he was never a roadblock for
someone else getting their work done. While in Developer Relations he
enjoyed showing other engineers how to do the same.

When not at work he is a proud cat dad to two calicoes and enjoys
spending his time drag racing and sailing. He is also an amateur
thinkfluencer on Twitter.
