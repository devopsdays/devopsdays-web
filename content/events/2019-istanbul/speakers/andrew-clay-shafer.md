Andrew Clay Shafer has been helping developers carry pagers for the last decade after having a caffeine induced vision while servers burned around him. Before that he was baptized in the fountain of Agile by a cult of cave dwelling witch doctors as a software developer with a background in math modeling and computational science.

Devops has been very good to Andrew and he has tried to return the favor. He spends most days trying to help Pivotal customers develop and operate software.
