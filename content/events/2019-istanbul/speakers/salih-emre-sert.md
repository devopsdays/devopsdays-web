Senior DevOps Engineer @VNGRS

Salih Emre helps companies adopting DevOps culture and helps teams developing Cloud Native Infrastructure and Software. Ever since he started playing basketball at the age of 11, he believes fundamentals, teamwork, communication and consistent practice with discipline enables you to meet success in every practice. He is also on a journey to find what do companies mean when they want to hire DevOps Engineers. His attempts have been unsuccessful for now.
