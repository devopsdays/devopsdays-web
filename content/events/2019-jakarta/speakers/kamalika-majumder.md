The words that best define myself - Consultant, Coach , Infra-dev, Sysadmin and Solo Traveller

I provide consulting to customers in a variety of domains like Product, Services, Consulting firms set up build and deliver automated infrastructure development and deployment across multiple platforms and clouds. I also help them to enable Devops and Continuous delivery practices in their organisation
I have been a system and network administrator in Infrastructure during early days of my career and then moved to be a Consultant for Infrastructure Engineering, Development and Delivery. 

I also like travelling , blogging , presenting and participating in conferences. I have recently published a tutorial for beginners in networking. This and many more blogs can be found in my blog site http://blogs.kamalika.net.
