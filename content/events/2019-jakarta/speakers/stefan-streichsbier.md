Stefan began his career in Security Assurance in 2003 and has since performed intrusive security testing across hundreds of corporate networks and business-critical applications. Afterward, Stefan has been focused on secure application development for web and mobile applications, using his skills as both a developer and security expert to champion Source Code Analysis and Secure Application Coding best practice. 

Stefan is regularly conducting security workshops, security awareness trainings, and frequently speaks at public events and conferences. Stefan has been dedicated to enabling organizations to rapidly deliver applications without creating a security bottleneck through application security programs and DevSecOps implementations.

Recently, Stefan founded GuardRails. A security platform that orchestrates open source security tools, curates their output and makes actionable results available in pull requests.

Stefan is a co-founder of the local DevSecOps Singapore Meetup group that is enjoying an active and ever-growing community. Stefan is also one of the core organizers of DevOpsDays Singapore, DevOpsDays Jakarta, and DevSecCon Asia.
