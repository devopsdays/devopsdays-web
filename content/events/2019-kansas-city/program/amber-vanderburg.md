In this high energy and highly interactive chat, attendees will become equipped and empowered with the resources, knowledge, and application of creating an organization of collaborative ownership through a little theory, a lot of practical application, some fun stories of success and failure, and loads of wit. Collaborative ownership is how our organizations thrive.

Attendees will learn:

How to transform a command-obey dynamic to one of creativity and innovation through opportunities for ownership. If we don’t own our projects, processes, roles, and methods then something/one else will. Through these opportunities, organizations can increase understanding, performance, and growth. Leaders can learn practical skills to increase ownership culture.

How to collaborate with opportunities for ownership through connectivity. Whether that be a team, goal, vision… and how to partner individual strengths to maximize collective success. If we can achieve our dreams all by ourselves, we are not dreaming big enough. Here are proved methods on how to increase connectivity and engagement in the team.

How to apply the ideas of collaborative ownership specifically in their organizations. Leaders, coaches, and trainers will learn about how to lead change effectively through theory, best practices, and mostly practical application to the organization. Rather than leaving with neat ideas, Amber will discuss step by step how to implement these ideas into specifically attendee workplaces.
