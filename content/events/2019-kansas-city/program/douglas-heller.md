What makes for a good application of machine learning?  This is a discussion of the various factors that come in to play while making the decision to incorporate machine learning into a task.  Some factors include (but are not limited to) 
* The current status of an application (i.e. does an application to accomplish this task already exist?)
* The task to which machine learning will be applied
* The current state/capabilities/limitation of machine learning technologies (in general - not specific technology stacks) 
* Examples of machine learning tasks and what results a user can expect
