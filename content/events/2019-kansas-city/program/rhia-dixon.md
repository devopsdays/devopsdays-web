Title = "CloudWatch-ing: Creating More Useful Logs & Alerts with AWS"

Logging is essential for visibility and resiliency, especially when monitoring and debugging software applications. However, overzealous logging of everything can do more harm than good. For integrated applications and multiple client environments, generating massive files of data no one reads can lead to days of troubleshooting and weeks of fixing the “fix”. The time lost multiplies when these logs live in various places with no system to sound the alarm. Learning to use AWS CloudWatch (or other cloud platforms) for streamlined, meaningful, centralized logging and alerts can drastically reduce the time it takes to notice issues, find bugs, and fix them.
A post-mortem revealed that visibility could have saved our teams days of firefighting and bug-hunting because we would have seen the break coming weeks in advance! Attendees will learn how we were able to pair CloudWatch with other third-party solutions to create a system (complete with logging, alerts, and dashboards) that has vastly improved our system resilience and nimbleness.
