Developers, start your engines.

AWS DeepRacer is the fastest way to get rolling with machine learning, literally. Get hands-on with a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, 3D racing simulator, and global racing league.

Join me Steph Hicks (Twitter@StephtheDevOps) for 90min of learning about Deep Racer and machine learning.

This limited capacity event requires access to an AWS Developer account, (the account is free) and the ability to spin up resources in that account (may cost up 10$ depending on the selections made). 

Agenda follows: 

* Overview of DeepRacer and the value of reinforcement learning 
* How to interact with the car
* Hands-on content
* Building your own models/testing
* Using the simulator
