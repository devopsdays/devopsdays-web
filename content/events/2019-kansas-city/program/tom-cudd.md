DevOps practitioners must get feedback from quality assurance and security testing as early in the development pipeline as possible. When continuously building and deploying web application projects, being able to run a test and get output on it within minutes is a super power skill that gets teams ahead of potential problems. In this workshop, be prepared to use Docker to run multiple tests on your websites, learn about what the different tests are used for, and then become familiar with the output to interpret them for actionable feedback. We will analyze at least the following testing capabilities:

 - Performance
 - Security
 - SEO
 - Accessibility

Dev, Ops, Sec, and QA resources should all gain knowledge about the entire pipeline and find new ways to collaborate on testing. Docker allows teams to experiment quickly and determine what systems help the work in the most useful way.
