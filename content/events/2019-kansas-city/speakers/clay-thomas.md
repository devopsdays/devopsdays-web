I have had a passion for computers ever since I was young enough to type on one. I love learning about new tools, technologies, and patterns in the "devops" world. Recently I have had a desire to learn more in the machine learning space of computer science and have been spending time practicing creating models on Kaggle.com (check it out it's free and awesome!) and learning about data science. In my personal time I enjoy home brewing and playing video games.
