I'm a Quality Engineer at RSA Archer working on machine learning based applications, as well as a brand-new CI/CD pipeline for a company that's been using the same release vehicle for almost two decades (DevOps transformation).  I can't get enough information about interesting technologies, especially as they pertain to the above fields.  Don't want to talk tech?  Let's chat about food, drinks, astronomy, or _your_ favorite hobby!
