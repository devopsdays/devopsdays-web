Kansas City native, Rhia Dixon is a software engineer at a data-driven tech company where she creates backend software applications using C#/.NET, Python, AWS and a variety of other tech. While she has always been a STEM girl and holds a B.S. in Physics, her journey to the world of tech kicked off in the summer of 2017 during a full-stack web development bootcamp at the University of Kansas-Edwards Campus. Rhia has immersed herself in the KC tech community by volunteering -- both as a mentor, and as Diversity & Inclusion Director -- for Kansas City Women in Technology, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing women in technology together and encouraging more women and girls to pursue careers in technology.

When sheâ€™s not writing code or volunteering, Rhia is chasing her toddler, making jewelry and crafty things for www.afromotif.com, binge-watching Marvel and Harry Potter movies, or spending time making memories with family and friends.
