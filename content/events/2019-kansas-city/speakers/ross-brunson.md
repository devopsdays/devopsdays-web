Ross has a long history in the world of Training, Certification and Career Enhancement. He began in the US Army and quickly began making applications in CPM, then MS-DOS and various Unices.

He is currently a Linux Training Architect II for LinuxAcademy, creating the next generation of online courses with the best hands-on labs around.

Ross recently spent a tour of duty at SUSE Inc. as their Certification Architect, remaking their Certification Program to modern standards, putting 10+ hands-on certifications into the market and inaugurating the first SUSE Enterprise Architects into the world.

Ross currently lives in Central Michigan with his family, enjoys hiking, water and winter sports and actually thinks he is a drummer, though others may disagree occasionally.
