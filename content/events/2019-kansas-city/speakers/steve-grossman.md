Experienced software sales engineer, servant-leader of pre-sales engineering teams and software engineer with focus on value stream management, agile development, software configuration management, and software delivery process improvement. I like helping clients understand their own software delivery value streams and apply tools to facilitating and automating those processes while making sure that organizational compliance initiatives are being followed. In my free time I enjoy technology, the outdoors and cars.
