As an advocate for DevOps within my organization, I've helped bring about a positive change in the way Development and Operations teams work together at VMLY&R. We've created homogeneous automation in an technical environment driven by the needs of each individual client on a different stack. We support application delivery and site reliability efforts for clients across the globe.
