Developers are making a difference in the world. We are solving hundreds of tough world problems. We invent and build lots of products which solve customers needs. And the considerable part of it is solutions for B2B. We are solving operational and productivity problems for fields like marketing, sales, finance, etc.
That is what we can do for the world, but who will care about our productivity and happiness?

That is time for a new evolution in Software development, and only developers can make it!
