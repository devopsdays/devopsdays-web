I want to share our recent discoveries in DevOps field. We started a new institution in DataRobot, called "Engineering Productivity". We took it very seriously and trying to hold all knowledge which can help to make our whole R&D department successful with the organization and for our customers. I'm gonna talk about productivity, what it is, what kind of things one should cover/consider if he wanna make real superheroes from your developers. This will cover processes/culture/technologies from a bit more high level than a usual devOps engineer can see.
