"This will never work here" is the sentiment we often hear from companies just starting their DevOps transformation. The good news is that change is possible. In this talk, Sasha will explain how Microsoft moved from the three-year waterfall software delivery cycle to deploying multiple times a day. Using the example of the live engineering environment for Azure DevOps Services, Sasha will walk through the process of updating older systems, transforming the automated tests, implementing CI/CD, and the major cultural changes that were needed to make it all possible.
