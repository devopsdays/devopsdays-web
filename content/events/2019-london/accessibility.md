At DevOpsDays London we're committed to removing barriers that would prevent anyone from accessing the event.

We will provide different coloured lanyards to indicate your willingness to be photographed, plus badge stickers to indicate if you want to talk to other attendees and pronoun stickers which we would like all attendees to use.

Additional facilities include gender neutral toilets and for those that need a break, we provide a quiet room.

## Live Captioning

As we've done previously, we'll be providing live captioning for those with hearing impairments along with live signing during the talks.

## Child Care Services

We will be providing childcare services during the event.

## Venue Accessibility

The area outside the venue is paved with smoothed cobbles that may be difficult to navigate for anyone requiring mobility assistance. There is smooth paving directly from the front door to the road for those arriving by car.

The venue is equipped with lifts, railed stairs and can accommodate further access requirements where required. More information is available [directly from the venue](https://qeiicentre.london/accessibility-information/).

If you have any concerns regarding accessibility please contact the organising team and we will be happy to discuss the available assistance and to help you plan your travel. We are able to cover the costs of local transport to the venue if it would otherwise prohibit you attending.

Any requests for monetary assistance must be made in advance.
