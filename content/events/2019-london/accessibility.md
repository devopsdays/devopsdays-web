At DevOpsDays London we're committed to removing barriers that would prevent anyone from accessing the event. 

The venue is equipped with lifts, railed stairs and can accommodate further access requirements where required.

<<<<<<< HEAD
As we've done previously, we'll be providing live captioning for those with hearing impairments along with live signing during the talks. 

We'll provide different coloured lanyards to indicate your willingness to be photographed, plus badge stickers to indicate if you want to talk to other attendees and pronoun stickers which we would like all attendees use.

Additional facilities include gender neutral toilets and for those that need a break, we provide a quiet room.
