Real world life lessons on successfully implementing SLIs and SLOs.
We started somewhere 3 years ago with help from Google CRE and iterated to a more mature understanding of SLIâ€™s as an accurate proxy for user pain, and adequate SLOs as a faithful threshold for tolerable user disruption. 
Will give an executive summary on the real world practical steps we took to bootstrap the SRE practices. Important lessons learned, tips and tricks of what we have picked up in the last 3 years
