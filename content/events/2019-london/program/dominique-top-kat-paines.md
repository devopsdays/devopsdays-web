Keeping up with the rate of change in the technology landscape is hard and attending local Meetups are often the best, easiest, and most cost-effective way to learn and interact with people who are trying to solve the same problems as you. They’re also a great way to socialise with people with similar interests. 

However, going to these events can be a daunting ordeal. In particular if you’ve just moved to the city, don’t have anyone to go with, or feel like you don’t ‘belong’ at a certain group because you haven’t used a certain technology yet. 

Meetup Mates was founded because at Tecknuovo we believe everyone should be able to enjoy these events as much as we do. With over 80 sign-ups in the first month, the goal is to make attending Meetups a more fun and inclusive experience for everyone. This ignite will provide you with more information, give you a platform to confidently go to your first Meetup, and provide you a network to share ideas and passions about technology.
