Some of the common question engineers have around monitoring are, “Why should
I monitor my service?”, “How do I monitor my service?” and “What tools do I use
to do this?”. In this talk we will go through some of the key reasons for us to
monitor our services and systems. We will then see some methods like the
USE(Utilisation, Saturation and Error) and RED(Rate Error Duration) methods
that help us identify what to monitor in a consistent manner. Lastly, we will
cover some broad classification of tools that help us achieve this including
some real examples of monitoring some systems and services at the Financial
Times.
