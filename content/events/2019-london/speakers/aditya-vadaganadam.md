I live in South London and a new local presenter to DevOpsdays London. I started my career in open systems and due to a HR error (no kidding) I was parachuted into a mainframe project where I was a developer for a while before getting back into the open systems. More recently  over the last few years, I have started focusing more on enabling mainframe teams to adopt modern ways of working and this time out of my own interest.
I help ​technology teams transform into simpler, smarter and safer delivery​ units by adopting agile principles and methods, DevOps approaches, modern engineering practices, lean process improvements and newer operating models. My career since 2000 has spanned the spectrum of software life cycle from development to deployment across modern digital and legacy technology stacks and diverse cultural contexts across Asia, Africa and Europe.
