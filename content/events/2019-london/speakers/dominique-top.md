As Co-Founder of Meetup Mates, DevOps Community Advocate and London’s Docker Community Leader (of the year!) Dominique has been a passionate part of the DevOps Community for the past few years and has attended many meetups and events. She runs the Docker London Meetup, Co-runs the Cloud Native London Meetup, on the committee for DevOpsDays London this year and is involved with a few of the other larger Meetup groups in London. When she’s not at tech events, Dominique geeks out over music - She’s a Techno DJ and a singer and very much a performer at heart.
