Marcel Britsch is an independent Digital Consultant, Product Owner and Business Analyst; born in Germany he has been living and working in London for over 15 years. He has worked with creatively and technically focused agencies and all sorts of clients across a wide variety of industry sectors including retail, automotive, finance, medical and energy.

He believes that project success is strongly linked to happy teams, value-focused decision- making and fast feedback cycles. As part of his role he is passionate about finding the best tools and techniques to optimise team culture, ways of working and solution design. He considers projects that follow classic waterfall / big-design-up-front practices to be too likely to be doomed to go anywhere near them, and will also stay away from transformation projects that are solely based on coaching. But has and will happily help organisations transform via practical involvement and by example.

Outside of work he is interested in SciFi and comic books, Theravada Buddhist mediation and number theory.
