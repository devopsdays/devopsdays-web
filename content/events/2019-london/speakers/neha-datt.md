Neha’s role as a product manager, trainer and coach is focused on bringing a people-centred approach to designing business strategy, delivering products and shaping organisational culture.

Her focus on people – while working within highly technical areas – is the result of over 15 years’ experience in designing and delivering intentional user experiences across a wide range of industries.

A strong advocate of lean, modern agile and service design, Neha helps organisations of all sizes - from startups to enterprises - to build products and teams that make a real difference to people.

Neha is a director of Mercurial Phoenix, a new venture studio and consultancy based in London, and a member of the Equal Experts network. She also finds it strange to write about herself in the 3rd person.
