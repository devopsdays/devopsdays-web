Nik Knight is not entirely sure how, as an English Lit and Philosophy graduate, she ended up in tech. However, having served time on first-line support, led multi-discipline Delivery Teams, and spent most of the past 20 years wrangling software releases into Production, she's here to stay.

A firm believer that technology is all about solving "people" problems, she has a keen enthusiasm for DevOps culture and mindset. She also holds an EMCC Foundation Award in Coaching, and likes nothing more than bringing these two strands together to help teams achieve more than they think is possible.

Outside of work, she unwinds by applying the 'fail fast' principle to yoga, child-rearing and occasionally, karaoke.
