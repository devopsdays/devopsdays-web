Oliver is a freelance IT consultant and DevOps trainer. He started out as software developer and later moved to IT operations, so that he has seen and lived both “sides” of the Dev - Ops continuum and was able to gather an overarching view of the problems and chances therein.

Oliver has well over 15 years of experience as software developer, operations engineer, certified Professional Scrum Master (scrum.org) and team lead.

He is not only interested in modern DevOps technologies but also focuses on the cultural aspects of DevOps and agile software development.
