Chaos engineering is the facilitation of controlled experiments to uncover systemic weaknesses.

Ana Medina and Rich Burroughs lead a hands-on tutorial on chaos engineering, covering the tools and practices you need to implement chaos engineering in your organization. Even if you’re already using chaos engineering, you’ll learn to identify new ways to use chaos engineering within your engineering organization and discover how other companies are using chaos engineering—and the positive results they have had using chaos to create reliable distributed systems.

*Prerequisites:*

- A laptop with the ability to SSH into a remote server. (You'll be provided with cloud infrastructure.)
