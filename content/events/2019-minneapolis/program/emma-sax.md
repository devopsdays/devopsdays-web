Some people say that the best thing you can do to test your knowledge of a topic is to explain it to someone else; so it follows that when people take the time to review others’ work, they often learn more than what they would’ve learned otherwise. Recently, I felt a similar experience in which I was asked to review a college student’s senior capstone project, which happened to focus on DevOps. l’d like to share what I learned through that process, what I discovered I already knew (even if I didn’t know I knew it), and how I bring that knowledge into my career and life going forward.
