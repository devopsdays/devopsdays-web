A deployment pipeline often consists of a Jenkins pipeline and a few commands to deploy a service. The problem with this is that most pipelines lack the intelligence necessary to make decisions based upon real-time data being generated. While not quite as bleeding edge as AI driven pipelines, it is a step in that direction where the pipeline knows how to make decisions using disparate data from the environment. The goal of the presentation is to provide an end to end example of how a deployment pipeline can become more intelligent by harnessing data that is already being captured in existing systems within the environment.
