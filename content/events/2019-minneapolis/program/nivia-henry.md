What if the code you’ve written alienated some of its users? Or what if it caused a group of people real-life harm? If you're a responsible engineer, these should be among your biggest concerns.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has introduced a new paradigm wherein code can do actual harm outside of its contained environment. While some of the effects may be comical (think: bad art made by AI), others can be deeply unfair to large groups of your users.

Come with Nivia, an engineering manager at Spotify, on a journey to explore the world of machine learning. We'll explore how algorithms are created, trained, and implemented, and more importantly, discuss practical steps to mitigate and eliminate such biases.
