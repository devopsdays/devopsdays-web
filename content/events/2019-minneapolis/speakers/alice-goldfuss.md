Alice Goldfuss is a systems punk currently helping GitHub run their cutting-edge container platform. She loves kernel crashes, memory design, and performance hacks. {{< emoji ":rainbow:" >}} {{< emoji ":floppy_disk:" >}} <img src="/images/octocat.png" height="24" width="24">

Alice has consulted on some books (_Docker: Up & Running_, _Effective DevOps_, _Site Reliability Engineering vol 2_), presented at some conferences (SREcon, Velocity, Container Summit), and run some others (LISA17, DevOps Days Portland). You can follow her on Twitter {{< emoji ":bird:" >}} (<a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss">@alicegoldfuss</a>), but youâ€™ll probably regret it.
