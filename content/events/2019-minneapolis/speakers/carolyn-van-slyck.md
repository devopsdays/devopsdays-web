Carolyn is a software developer based in the wilds of suburban Chicago, working remote on the Microsoft Cloud Native Team. Her passion is developer tools, and building vibrant inclusive open-source communities around them.

She is maintainer for the CNAB Spec, Duffle and Porter, Kubernetes Service Catalog and the GoMods Athens Proxy. Carolyn runs Women Who Go, and organizes for the Chicago chapters of Women Who Go and Write/Speak/Code.

In between code reviews, Carolyn hauls her cookies around the world to share her love of open-source, containers, and excessive emoji. {{< emoji ":rainbow:" >}} {{< emoji ":sparkles:" >}}
