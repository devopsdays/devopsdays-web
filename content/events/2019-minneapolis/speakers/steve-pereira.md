Steve is a long time DevOps fan and organizer of Toronto's largest DevOps meetup and DevOps Days Toronto. He's been working in process automation since 2001, most recently a SaaS founding CTO and now founder of [vzbl.io](https://vzbl.io) helping teams level up with DevOps and Value Stream Mapping. Despite being born & raised in, and a proud resident of Toronto, he's quite allergic to winter, but only recently built up the courage to escape.
