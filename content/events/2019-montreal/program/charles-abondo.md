Celebrating 100 years of operational excellence, CN is a world-class transportation leader and the only transcontinental railway in North America. Our 19,500 mile network spans Canada and Mid-America, connecting three coasts. A true backbone of the economy, CN handles over $250 billion worth of goods, hauls about 20% of Canada’s exports and carries more than 300 million tons of cargo annually.

As CN modernizes operations and builds the digital railroad of the future, our strategy is predicated upon building the right technical foundations and enablers that help future proof operations and safely deliver value throughout the supply chain. With so many options and implementations of DevSecOps, what are the best patterns and anti-patterns that create the right recipe for success?

In this paper, we will discuss how the rise and prominence of scaled agile is helping CN collaborate and deliver to the business and our customers more safely and efficiently. We will explore the concept of having a strategy around DevSecOps that provides an essential ingredient to growth and productivity. Some of the key questions we propose to answer in this paper cover top of mind concerns like:

How does DevSecOps work in an environment where safety is critical?
How do analog, digital & modernization coexist?
How do we bring security to move from on-premise to cloud?
How do we mobilize our organization and talent to deliver?
How do we find the right service integrator to partner with?

From design, through the development process to production support, this paper will walk you through CN’s DevSecOps modernization journey and provide fundamental learnings along the way.
