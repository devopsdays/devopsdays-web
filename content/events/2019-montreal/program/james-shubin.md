Mgmt is a real-time automation tool that is fast and safe.
It uses a real-time, reactive programming language to model the desired state over time, and a powerful event-driven engine to apply this state.
In this workshop, we'll present a number of live demos, and get you running mgmt yourself, and writing your first module.
This is the modelling language and tool that will let module authors build autonomous self-hosted mail servers, well-managed personal "home clouds", and other useful bits.

Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.

A number of blog posts on the subject are available: https://purpleidea.com/tags/mgmtconfig/
Attendees are encouraged to read some before the workshop if they want a preview!

Attendees must arrive with a modern GNU+Linux machine, running golang 1.11 or newer or an equivalent virtual machine.
You will also need to complete the mgmt "quick start guide" to get mgmt running before you arrive.
https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/blob/master/docs/quick-start-guide.md
Doing this will leave us a maximum amount of time for hands on experience with mgmt.
If you have any difficulties, please join the #mgmtconfig IRC channel on Freenode and ask purpleidea for help.
