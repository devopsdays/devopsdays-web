Building on a foundation of Value Stream Mapping and Flow, I'll guide the group through a real Value Stream case and build our own ideal future state. We'll dig into the measurements, risks, and opportunities, then look at real tactics and strategies to paint a dramatically different picture. I'll act as our Dungeon Master to facilitate the session, throw monkey wrenches and share my perspective, but this will be mostly a collaborative exercise that will leave you with the skills to run your own VSM sessions.
