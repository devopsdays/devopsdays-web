How can you make time for real innovation and improvement? How do you know what to automate or invest in? How do you escape process prison? How can you get everyone aligned to make a difference? How can you start to drive revenue from tech?

This talk introduces how I use Value Stream Mapping as the one technique I’ve always returned to when I need to drastically improve teams I’ve joined and led over my 20+ year career in tech. You can use it right away to understand, communicate and improve your work, team or organization - whether you’re a leader or new recruit.
