I’m a software developer specialized in computer vision and medical imaging research, with a strong focus on practical applications, including VR and AR. I have worked for all of my career in high-stakes software development, and I’ve been heavily involved with testing strategy and software development processes. My experience spans startups as well as large institutions. I’m currently a researcher at the National Research Council Canada, studying the convergence of gaming technology, virtual and augmented reality, and cognitive health.
