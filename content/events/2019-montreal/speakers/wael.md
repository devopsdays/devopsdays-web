My years in research, programming, and robotics have fuelled my passion for automation to help companies overcome challenges of development and growth. That’s why I strive to automate myself out of my clients’ jobs to ensure their success. After nearly 6 years of working on DevOps problems, I am now building Dops, a revolutionary approach to scaling software development automation!
