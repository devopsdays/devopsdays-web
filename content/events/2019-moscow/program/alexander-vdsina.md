Once upon a time my colleague Daniil Markovich said that people end up in our occupation against their will 

Because it's hard to expect sensible results from forced people, we have no other choice but to push ourselves. That leads to so-called burnout and other problems.

My talk will not be dedicated to struggle with burnout, because burnout is usually diagnosed via its symptoms and not the cause. I'll talk about my personal experience that led me to a (limited) understanding of how our brains work.

In practical terms, I'll introduce the attendees to some techniques that help me to survive the crazy rhythm of a big city.
