What does "corporate knowledge" mean? – No, it's not a documentation...

Are you involved into knowledge management processes within your company? – Sure. Permanently. Do you see the difference between "knowledge base" and "knowledge management system"? – Yes, I do. Knowledge management in Agile company? Really? – Sure! Even Agile-manifest includes several directions to this.

Those and other questions I get (almost) every time I'm speaking about knowledge management with yet another person of software development company. It shows that there is no a proper understanding of knowledge management in IT community unlike banking, retail, metallurgy, oil industry and even Russian Railways and Russian Post.

I will speak about:
– why knowledge management is a mandatory part of evry business nowadays,
– why the main problem of knowledge management is habits,
– why it is so hard to run knowledge management "from below", and sometimes even "from above",
– which way knowledge management affects time-to-market and business safety,
and also I'll show some simple tools to implement them quickly within your own teams and/or businesses.
