My team works on Facebook's internal distributed queues.

We provide low-level message-passing service for lots of customers within Facebook at planet-scale.

As a Production Engineers we support the whole lifecycle of our service, create automation solutions for it and sometimes fix incidents on the fly.

I'll tell how do we work in general, what are our relationships to Software Engineers, what tools do we use in every-day work and what kind of automation we create and support.
