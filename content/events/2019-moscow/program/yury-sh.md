How to solve all these tasks and don't become crazy?

I will not talk about it in my talk. ))) But I can tell with what technical and process problems we met building DevSecOps and how we solved it from security point of view. Indeed â€“ real cases and truly working tips.

How to make usage of different tools (static and dynamic analyzers and Open-Source control) convenient for developers and security? What integrations are impossible and how to use them? How to integrate non-integratable security tools into processes so you can use them? How do not stop development with all of it? And of course how do not become bold and stay alive?
