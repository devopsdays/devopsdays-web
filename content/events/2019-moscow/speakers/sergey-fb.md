Currently Production Engineer at Facebook, formerly Systems Engineer at Yandex and Mail.Ru. For about 5 years I was working mostly with distributed systems in general and distributed storages in particular. Now I'm working on internal Facebook distributed queues solution called LogDevice (logdevice.io).
