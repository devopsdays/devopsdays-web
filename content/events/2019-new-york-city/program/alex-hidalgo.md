Developing meaningful SLIs is not an easy task, but your Error Budgets and your SLOs are only useful if they’re informed by good SLIs. In this talk we’ll be performing a deep dive on how to develop SLIs that actually reflect the journeys of your users. We’ll start by describing an example web service that should look familiar to you, identify the “low-hanging fruit” metrics you might be tempted to use, talk about the limitations of these low-hanging fruit, and conclude with some concrete examples of what useful SLIs for such a system might actually look like.
