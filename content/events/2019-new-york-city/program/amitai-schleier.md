When we’re responsible for production, it can be hard to find room to learn. That’s why I run my own email server. It’s still “production” — if it stays down, that’s pretty bad — but I own all the decisions, take more risks, and have learned lots. And so can you! Come see why and how to get started.

With one command, install famously secure email software. A couple more and it’s running. A few more and it’s encrypted. Twiddle your DNS, watch the mail start coming in, and start feeling responsible for a production service in a way that web hosting can’t match.
