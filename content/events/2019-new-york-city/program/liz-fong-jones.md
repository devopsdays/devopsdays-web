Our job as engineers does not stop with eliminating technical defects and ensuring high reliability. Engineers of all kinds must ensure their work serves the public good. A service that reliably harms, exacerbates injustices, or excludes marginalized groups is not a service worth building and maintaining. Learn how to effectively accomplish change in your working conditions or your employer’s products through grassroots employee advocacy, from an employee advocate who has successfully lobbied their employer to change both product policies and working conditions for the better.
