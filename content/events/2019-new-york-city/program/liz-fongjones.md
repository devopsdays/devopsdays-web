Our job as engineers does not stop with eliminating technical defects and ensuring high reliability. Engineers of all kinds must ensure their work serves the public good. A service that reliably harms, exacerbates injustices, or excludes marginalized groups is not a service worth building and maintaining. Learn how to effectively accomplish change in your working conditions or your employerâ€™s products through grassroots employee advocacy, from an employee advocate who has successfully lobbied their employer to change both product policies and working conditions for the better.
