I’ll touch on these myths and more: Innersource gives me free developers!; Innersource will fix my bugs; Innersource is more risky; I can Innersource my way out of my current job and into a new one altogether!

I’ll then show an example of the success Innersource has had at Verizon through our Kubernetes journey and MyVerizon, the mobile app millions of customers rely on to manage their Verizon services.
