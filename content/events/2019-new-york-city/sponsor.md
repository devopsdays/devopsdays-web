We appreciate our sponsors for this Open Event! If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}.

<hr/>

<p>devopsdays NYC is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not sell presentation slots, or distribute attendee contact lists to sponsors. Gold sponsors may have the opportunity to offer a short message during the program, between talks. All sponsors will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event.</p>

<p>Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.</p>

<p>Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors share a table with another sponsor where they can interact with interested attendees during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces. This is a community-focused conference, so a traditional marketing tone will probably work against sponsors who want to engage with attendees.</p>

<p>We recommend sponsors send their engineers to interact with the attendees at devopsdays NYC, on their own terms.</p>
