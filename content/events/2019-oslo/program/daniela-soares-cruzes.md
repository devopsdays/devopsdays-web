To overcome organizational inertia or fierce opposition and move new ideas, innovate processes in organizations, requires champions. Yet we do not know much about what makes some champions effective while others fail to deliver the goods. What I discovered by studying Security Champions for improving Security Processes in Agile Teams is that effective champions differ from ineffective ones but that also the way that leaders work with the champions also impact in their effectiveness. I believe that we could use more of the concept of champions to drive innovation in software development processes. I conclude with seven action steps that leaders can take to breed, rather than block, potential champions in their organizations.
