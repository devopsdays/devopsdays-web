N26 has a mission: To build the bank the world loves to use. While we’re currently live in countless countries in the EU, we plan on launching in the US later this year, and also have immediate plans for Brazil and beyond. With every market launch comes a multiplier in complexity in our infrastructure, including configuration management, pipeline modifications, and application provisioning. In a company that’s witnessing rapid growth and change, how does N26 manage to separate these concerns and allow teams to be autonomous as possible, while also ensuring the reliability and consistency to our deployments to all regions?
