Devops in regulated industries

Many industries regulate and audit the software development process to ensure safety or security risks are managed in a professional and repeatable manner.  This makes sense if you are handling financial transactions, air traffic control, insulin pumps and car braking systems.

Proving compliance with regulation is an under-served area of devops. Most regulations are written with general guidance, not specifying the exact recipe to follow. In order to comply, organizations implement manual processes and gate-checks, with every software release documenting the proof that the agreed processes have been followed.

This is a great space to add some devops magic!

This talk will give a introduction to regulated software development and operations, and show how devops approaches can help ensure compliance.
