Most of the IT projects fails not due to technical problems but because people find it hard to talk to each other, communicate their needs, share their ideas and worries. This is especially important in the IT world that is based on creativity and constant learning. Research shows that successful Teams are not successful because they are technically more advanced, but they are able to communicate openly. We may deny that psychology is as important as our technical and professional skills, as I was doing a few years ago, but actually they way we adjust our communication to the peers is even more important than the work we do.
In this session I will briefly tell my story from zero empathy person to psychology-aware team player.
