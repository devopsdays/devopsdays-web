A talk about why your infrastructure still Is important based on a real major incident that caused “Some minor delays for some customers” at Volvo Cars earlier this year.

This is about how we have used config management experience to build up and manage our Kubernetes environment to make it stable and robust and now proven in battle .

This talk will also describe how we have built technology, organisation and teams to try to create a Devops culture to support development and operation of www.volvocars.com
