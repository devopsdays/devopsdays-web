There is a delicate balance between empowering teams with freedom of choice and empowering by removing undifferentiated lifting. In this talk, I will discuss how Comcast is building consensus around common technologies such as cloud, CI/CD and operational visibility. Topics that will be covered are, identifying where to consolidate, convincing engineers to change technologies and being open and transparent. Attendees of this talk will walk away with a view of our process. They will be able to take the solution or pieces of the solution and apply it to areas of their organization where consensus is needed such as diversity or office configuration.
