Solely mastering technologies in your field is not going to be enough level you up in your career. Often times we overlook our nontechnical skill building. This talk discusses the most important nontechnical skills to excel in your technical career.

You have a million different technologies listed on your resume. Youâ€™ve master many tools, and continue to stay on top of the newest technologies. So what is missing in your personal development? How can you level up in your career? Often times we overlook our nontechnical skill building. Nontechnical skills include both interpersonal and intrapersonal skills as well as any other skill not directly required to complete your IT tasks. These skills are important because they effect how you complete your day to day tasks. In this talk, I plan to highlight what I think are the most useful nontechnical skills to have in a technical field. My hope is that once these skills are brought to your attention, you will be more conscious in building them and they will help you to excel in your career. The good things about these skills is that, unlike the trendiest software, they will always be the same!
