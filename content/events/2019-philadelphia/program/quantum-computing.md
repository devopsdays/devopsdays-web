A mathematician, a data scientist, a computer scientist and a physicist walk into a room sounds like the start of a joke. It is actually the average quantum computing (QC) meetup. Gartner warned executives to consider hiring PHDâ€™s even though many will not use QC for possibly a decade. QC is already helping classical computing with improved algorithms, so we should be aware of what QC is and where it can be useful today.
