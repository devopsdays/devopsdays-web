Traveling with multiple electronic devices can be a chore, especially with constraints on size and the hurdles of security. We can try to solve this problem by using a remote desktop accessible from any of our devices but that can take time to set up! What happens when we need another remote desktop quickly? How can we create a remote desktop as on-demand as a container or virtual machine in our datacenter?

In this talk, we’ll apply infrastructure-as-code to create a continuously delivered remote desktop experience. While there are some limitations to a seamless user experience for a remote desktop, we’ll review tools allow us to automate creation and configuration and techniques to ensure it is built reliably. By applying infrastructure-as-code to remote desktop, we can create an immutable remote desktop image, deploy replicas based on our geographic location, and test if our development environment is ready for use.
