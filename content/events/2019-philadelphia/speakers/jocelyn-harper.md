Jocelyn had a large passion for technology since the age of 9 where she taught herself HTML and CSS to build websites and design layouts in Paint Shop Pro. Many years and Java coding boot camp later, she is a Senior Associate Software Engineer at Capital One where she is enjoying working as a full-stack engineer and is also the host of Git Cute Podcast, a technology podcast that is aimed at providing technology and career advice without the humdrum and heaviness of technical jargon. Outside of work, Jocelyn devotes a portion of her time to traveling around the country giving technical presentations and talks about diversity and inclusion within the tech sector. With the rest of her time, you can find her decompressing with video games and spending too much time on Twitter.
