Jon Moore is the Chief Software Architect at Comcast Cable, where he
focuses on leading the company to continually sharpen its delivery of its
software-based products. He specializes in the "art of the possible," finding
ways to coordinate working solutions for complex problems and deliver them
on time (even in large enterprises). Jon is equally comfortable leading and
managing teams and personally writing production-ready code.

Jon has a passion for software engineering, continuously learning and then
teaching colleagues new ways to deliver working, maintainable software with
ever-higher quality and ever-shorter delivery times.  His current interests
include distributed systems, fault tolerance, building healthy and engaging
engineering cultures, and Texas Hold'em.  Jon received his Ph.D. in Computer
and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania and currently
resides in West Philadelphia, although he was neither born there nor raised
there and does not spend most of his days on playgrounds.
