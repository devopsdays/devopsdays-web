I have 11 years of experience working with IT, with focus on software testing, quality engineering and agile. Last years I'm focusing my career on test automation, performance test, agile methodologies and team leadership.

I have large experience on testing field in general and I'm always looking for techniques and practices to burst quality on digital projects and products. I believe that quality is a common interest to entire team, not only for QAs and testers, but this roles means "be the first one preoccupied on prevent problems early and reduce waste".
