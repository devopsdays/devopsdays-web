Tim Gross is a software engineer at HashiCorp, where he works on the Nomad core team. Previously, he's been a developer, sysadmin, developer advocate, engineering manager, and devops engineer (whatever that is!) at a handful of startups including Joyent and DramaFever. Recently he's also been coaching engineering teams at startups and fledgling non-profits as an independent consultant.  A long time ago in a galaxy far far away Tim used to design buildings instead of software. He mostly worked on safety-sensitive projects like biosafety labs, pharma manufacturing, hazmat, and even bomb-proofing a few times. Which turn out to be shockingly transferable skills for diving into a typical code base.
