Working together online in Open Source communities can be very hard. It doesn't have to be this way. Come to this talk to hear how we in Open Source communities have the ability to hold ourselves and each other to a higher standard. A higher standard in the code we write, in how we interact with each other, in how we build technology together as humans. Leave knowing how we - every one of us - can lead the Open Source world together in a positive direction.
