If you've learned just enough git to get by, but are ready to take your version control collaboration skills to the next level, this workshop is for you. We will cover "201" level skills like handling merge conflicts and rebasing, but we will also discuss how to collaborate with other contributors in a way that increases community health and productivity. You'll learn more if you bring a laptop to follow along with, but one is not required.
