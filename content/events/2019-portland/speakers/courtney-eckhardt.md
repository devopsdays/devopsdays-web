Courtney comes from a background in customer support and internet anti-abuse policy. She combines this human-focused experience with the principle of Conwayâ€™s Law and the work of Kathy Sierra and Don Norman into a wide-reaching and humane concept of operational reliability. You can find her knitting in the audience of conference talks, and she's always interested in cat pictures.
