The creation of the base cluster infrastructure, sitting outside of the deployment pipelines, was automated through Terraform. The Kubernetes deployment themselves were generated using Rudder, a simple internal templating engine (instead of Helm), and deployed using the same base processes and CD pipelines used in the on-premises infrastructure. Another aspect that needed some attention was connectivity between datacenters as the component both uses and is used by other components, so a VPN was necessary. We will walk the audience through our journey, also expanding on the problems we faced and how we overcame them.
