Come and meet the story behind a unicorn’s on-call program. Almost three years ago we didn’t have a structured program to support on-call engineers… and with the scaling of the engineering team it was pretty clear that we needed something in place. We went from zero to have software engineers on-call and now we even have a 2.0 version of the program. Join me travelling through time and get a grasp about how it was to create a on-call program from scratch and the pitfalls that we faced.
