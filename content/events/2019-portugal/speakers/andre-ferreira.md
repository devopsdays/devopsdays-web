#### Speaker

I'm a Senior Cloud Automation Engineer at Blip / PaddyPowerBetfair, working on providing an internal PaaS layer on top of our on-premise OpenStack cloud. We've recently made a number of PoCs regarding containerisation, container orchestration and hybrid-cloud solutions with the 3 main cloud providers.
I come from a Backend background where I was developing high-throughput services. I eventually took a shot at the automation side of life and found out that there is a lot of development to be done in the land of SysAdmins.
Free time is spent with the wife, the dog, reading, gaming and developing games for fun.
