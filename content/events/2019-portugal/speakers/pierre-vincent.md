#### Speaker

I am originally from a Software Development background and the rise of DevOps drove me to become more involved in how systems actually run in the real-world, and how I could make a difference helping others care about the applications they release to production.

I am currently Infrastructure & Reliability Manager at Poppulo, where Iâ€™m responsible for our continuous delivery platform and the operations of our hybrid on-prem/cloud infrastructure.
