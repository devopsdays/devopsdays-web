#### Keynote Speaker

* I’m currently an Engineering Program Manager at Google. Graduated as an Electrical engineer, started as a test automation engineer, then software engineer and took on DevOps (including disaster recovery) responsibilities at my previous company, where I graduated into the role of a Lead App Performance analyst.
* I’ve also taught Bollywood dancing and done stage shows as a principal dancer!
* I live in the city of San Francisco, and I love the freedom (something I never had growing up).
* Passionate about traveling and exploring cuisines.
* Always open to new experiences.
