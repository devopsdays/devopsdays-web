I was hired for a position called "DevOps Engineer". Over the years I tried to prove that DevOps is a culture, not person in product team. Few months ago we started an experiment and detached all DevOps Engineers from their teams to form a group of floating consultants. In this talk I would like to share with you why we wanted to change, what we have changed and how it turned out.
