This is our true story of juggling hot potatoes. In other words - the why and the how of a modern incident management process in the fast-paced world of online media.

Media-focused products have one thing in common - high-velocity deployment environments. From that perspective, we want to show how our 50 teams have dealt with performance issues, outages, errors, etc.. since the 90’s. We want to share with you why we built a whole automation process around our incident management in the first place, and why we implemented DevOps culture across our organization. We’ll look at it from two perspectives: taking a process-centered and a technology-centered approach to answer some difficult questions: What does DevOps mean for us now? How to deal with On-Call? How did this change our uptime?
