#### Speaker

A development is the key - multi directional, dynamic, coordinated. That’s why I administrate, program, take photos. Sometimes I write stories and I tale stories from very far worlds. I think, that world is too interesting to close on any of its aspects. I’m professionally IT engineer, I’m interested in IT administration and system engineering. I’ve also worked with developers teams as IT administrator.
