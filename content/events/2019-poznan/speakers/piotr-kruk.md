#### Speaker

Piotr Kruk is a Software Engineer at PaaS team in DreamLab. My work focuses on the idea of building fully autonomous systems in which applications are not limited by the limits of a specific platform. Iâ€™m ensuring that the systems I take care of are fully optimized, automated and reliable. In DreamLab I develop and maintain a PaaS orchestration and monitoring systems working on a our private cloud (OpenNebula, OpenStack) and AWS. I also create and design tools for our programmers which keeps a platform environment they use as effective as possible.
