#### Speaker

When promises had still been named callbacks and event handlers were those people who organized club nights, that’s when I started JavaScript :). But meanwhile I grew up and since I was not able to learn ES6 from blog posts, I wrote es6katas.org and inspired by Corey Haines’ Global Day of Coderetreat I started the JSCodeRetreat, for practicing to code better. But I am still learning, there is no end it seems.
