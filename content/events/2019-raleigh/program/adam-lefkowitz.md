In 2001, a group of software engineers introduced the Agile Manifesto to help teams adopt a more lightweight software development process.   Most organizations were riding the Agile wave through some form of transformation by the late 2000s.  Many of these transformations stalled out and were fraught with challenges.  

As we head into 2020, the DevOps wave is in full effect and many organizations are falling prey to some of the same patterns that thwarted Agile transformations.  In this talk, you will learn about these patterns and techniques of how organizations can learn from the past to effectively implement DevOps.
