"Known vulnerabilities are a fact of life with open source software.  According to the Snyk State of Open Source Security Report 2019, last year vulnerabilities for npm (Node) grew by 47% while Maven Central (Java) and PHP Packagist disclosures grew by 27% and 56% respectively.  They also tracked over 4 times more vulnerabilities found in RHEL, Debian and Ubuntu as compared to 2017. According to the Sonatype 2019 DevSecOps Community Survey, 24% of organizations surveyed revealed a breach within one of their web applications in the prior 12 months.

A tiny security team canâ€™t handle all of the IT security work alone; your entire development and operations team will need to develop an awareness of security tooling and best practices. Learn how to level up the IT security skills and practices in your organization in just a few months!"
