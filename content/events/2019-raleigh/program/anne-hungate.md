IT organizations that don’t know their risk factors and exposure are likely to make investments in DevOps that don’t matter. After working with several teams that lost their DevOps funding after making automation investments in areas that were not business constraints, Anne Hungate's “Know Your Numbers” model emerged. Join Anne to learn how to prioritize your DevOps improvements and demonstrate the impact and value you are delivering. After all, DevOps gets traction and funding when teams can show the business impact of doing it, so if you want your DevOps initiative to take off, be prepared to provide some metrics! You'll discover the five key questions you need to be able to answer to show that your DevOps matters, and leave with seven actions you can start taking as soon as you get back to your desk in order to improve the results of your DevOps efforts.
