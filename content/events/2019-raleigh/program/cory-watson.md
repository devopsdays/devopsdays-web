It’s 3am and you’ve just been dreaming about something great then poof: the phone rings. You’re on call this week and something seems to’ve gone awry. Welcome to a critical point in running modern computer systems.

The alerts that hound us are rarely designed to help us and they create a lot of stress and angst. We often ignore alerts, relegating them to empty mailing lists or unread Slack channels.

In this talk we’ll discuss the CASE Method: A vendor neutral, software-free process that works for one person or a whole company. It’s about improving context, keeping attention focused, and learning from our changes. Let’s make alerting better for humans!
