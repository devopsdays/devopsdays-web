Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of principles, practices, and organizational constructs that seek to balance the reliability of a service with the need to continually deliver new features. An error budget is the primary construct used to help balance these seemingly competing goals. This workshop introduces error budgets and their components: service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). Participants will learn the art of creating and implementing SLOs through a series of guided discussions and group exercises.
