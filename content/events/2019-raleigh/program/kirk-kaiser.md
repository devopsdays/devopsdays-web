"There are many options to build and deploy machine learning models to production at scale. We’ll walk through the growing suite of tools to centralize model building and deployment at scale, with technologies like Kubeflow, Seldon and TensorRT. Finally, we’ll address techniques for monitoring these new services.

You’ll walk away with an understanding of a complete development lifecycle for scalable machine learning services."
