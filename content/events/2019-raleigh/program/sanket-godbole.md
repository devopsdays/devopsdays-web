This talk describes our journey through the Clouds! At Nuage Networks we build SDN products and services that can be deployed anywhere. Our traditional CI/CD system has been testing on local Openstack Cloud. In our effort to scale dynamically based on demand, we explored the two Cloud service providers, Google Cloud Platform(GCP) and Amazon Web Services(AWS). This talk describes our struggles, accomplishments, and lessons learned using both platforms. It will compare and contrast the two platforms in the process and explain why one works out better for us than the other.
