Andy is a software engineer working for IBM in Austin, Texas on the WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty products. He has about 15 years of experience in software development with various job titles – Release Engineering, Build, Automation, Continuous Delivery, DevOps – that all center around getting software built, tested, and released on time. When he’s not running a build and test infrastructure, he can be found running marathons around the country, or just running to catch his toddler son and daughter.
