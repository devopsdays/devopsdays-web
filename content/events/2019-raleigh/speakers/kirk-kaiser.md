I'm currently at Developer Evangelist at Datadog.

Previously, I was the lead backend developer at Triller, scaling to the app from zero to millions of users, and handling the traffic from the top 100 iOS and Android stores at the same time.

I wrote a book teaching Python programming through art instead of print statements and math puzzles. Itâ€™s called Make Art With Python, and it's the book I wish I'd read when I started programming.
