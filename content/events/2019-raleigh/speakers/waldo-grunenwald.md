Waldo is a geek. If you find him odd, there are plenty of things you could blame that on.  He's a long-time sys/ops engineer, enjoys leading teams, and is active in the DevOps community.  He may or may not be Batman.  He is pretty keen on helping organizations stop hurting themselves, insight tooling (trending/monitoring/alerting), automation in general, and actually enjoys public speaking.  He takes joy in helping teams and organizations stop hurting themselves.  He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.
