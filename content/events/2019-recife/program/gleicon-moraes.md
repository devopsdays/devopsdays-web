My first contact with kubernetes was by the end of 2015, more because of Go than the clunky orchestration system. At the time my company was looking to a PaaS that could help ease the life of our developers and after trying mostly everything weâ€™ve decided to start a project called Teresa to create an abstraction over k8s. Turns out that implementing and maintaining kubernetes can become a full time time job that never ends - the very thing that ops complain about devs. In the middle of this complexity, entire teams feed of this complexity and building automation with the proper pipeline might take a long time and still feel clunky. Fast forward to Nubank - kubernetes power a platform that serves 15MM customers and what struck me is what happens after building your deploy pipeline is not a problem or a full time project anymore.
