At its core, DevOps is a culture of empathy. It addresses the pain points in software development by removing silos, automating processes, and building culture. During this talk you will hear personal stories of failure, growth, and success. From the stress of being a lead developer on one of the world’s largest accounting firm’s first Agile project, to my attempt and failure at implementing a DevOps transformation, to actually having a successful DevOps implementation. This talk will cover burnout, depression, failure, lessons learned, and culture, along with eventual success.
