I’ve been working with dev and ops teams for more than 20 years, looking into culture dynamics that power these teams. I’ve wrote two books - “Programação Avançada em Linux - 2005” and “Caixa de ferramenta devops - 2015” plus developed a bunch of opensource projects that can be found at my github page https://github.com/gleicon. Currently I work at Nubank as VP of Engineering.
