I advocate for a better workplace culture. I believe in coding with empathy and that we all should strive for the best in each other. It is only through listening and acknowledging other’s pain while recognizing our own privileges that we can improve.

I have been writing code since the age of 15. Starting out on my TI-85 graphing calculator then graduating to BASIC, COBOL, and C+ (I haven’t touched any of these since high school). Eventually I settled into C# where I focus primarily on back-end APIs. Until recently, I’ve spent the majority of my career writing code for the Department of Defense. Currently I am working as a consultant specializing in .NET Core, Azure, with a sprinkle of DevOps.
