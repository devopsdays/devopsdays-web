There's a lot of money floating around in the tech industry and employees are disadvantaged in a negotiation, since we don't know what they have to offer you. I want to make the negotiation process in tech less of a mystery, so that everyone goes in prepared for the compensation talk.

By the end of my talk, the audience should know:

- What to ask for.
- How to ask for it.
- And how to set themselves up for their next promotion in that negotiation.
