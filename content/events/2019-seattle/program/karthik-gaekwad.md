"How are you doing?" is a question that is frequently asked but seldom heard. In our busy lives today working to solve devops related problems, many of us put aside "everything else", to spend more time solving the problems with Kubernetes clusters, or writing code to minimize on call burdens. Then, we realize we're "burned out", and take time to fix ourselves. We notice coworkers completely burned out and realize they aren't themselves anymore.

In this talk, I will talk about burn out, and mental health from a devops standpoint. Burnout isn't a new issue, and many other well-established professions deal with similar issues of the workforce being "tired", and having a hard time being enthusiastic about work. I'll spend time talking about early warning signs for burnout, how other professions deal with this, and steps you can take to continuously enjoy whatever you're working on!
