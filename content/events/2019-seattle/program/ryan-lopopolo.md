When my team chooses to run infrastructure on AWS, the breadth of services enables rapid prototyping and the elasticity of the cloud enables immense scale. This flexibility comes at a cost, reflected in the complex, sometimes opaque, bill we receive at the end of the month. Deciphering the bill is joint effort between data science, engineering, and finance. Using the bill to understand our usage requires a data warehouse and enough SQL to power 1000 homes in Seattle. Turning that understanding into cost optimizations takes hacking our code, infrastructure, and organizational processes.
