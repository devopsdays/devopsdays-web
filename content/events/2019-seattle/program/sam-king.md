When healthcare.gov came out, it seemed like everything went wrong, but a few months later, people were getting healthcare, and the site continued to improve over time. A big part of the change was introducing the culture of DevOps into the government agency and contractors behind that website.

While there was some initial resistance, there was also real, lasting change for the better. In this talk, you'll hear about how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services started to embrace DevOps and you'll learn some principles of cultural change that you can apply to your own organization.
