Professional Connector-- Account Manager @ Randstad -- Forever Student

Ashina’s been in tech recruiting since finishing her Master’s degree in English Literature in 2015. She is passionate about technology and dedicated to making tech a more desirable and accessible career for women and minorities. She spends her evenings at local tech meetups and her days on-site with local tech companies who need help hiring. She is an advocate for women and other underrepresented groups within technology, but is a connector for anyone that asks.
