Writes software, likes post-its. Co-founder & CPO @ Honeycomb.io

Christine delights in being a developer in a room full of ops folks. As a cofounder/CPO of Honeycomb.io, a startup with a new approach to debugging production systems, she cares deeply about bridging the gap between devs and ops with technological and cultural improvements, so that we can all go back to bed more quickly if we have to get paged at 3am. Before Honeycomb, she built out an analytics product at Parse (bought by Facebook) and wrote software at a few now-defunct startups.
