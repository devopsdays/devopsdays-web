Senior Manager, Delivery Pipeline @ SAP Concur

I am an engineer at heart with a passion for development level automation. I have a broad spectrum of experience ranging from my early days writing COBOL on mainframes to building microservices in the cloud. I lead teams that build, support and promote our delivery pipeline solution at SAP Concur. I have been with the company for over four years helping to build the foundation and to lead the growth to over 1,000 repository pipelines.
