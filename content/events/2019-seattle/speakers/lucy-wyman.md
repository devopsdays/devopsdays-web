Software Engineer for Bolt at Puppet

I'm a software engineer for Puppet, where I'm currently working on our open source remote task runner Bolt. I graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June 2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU Open Source Lab. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing new things, and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books, and other media.
