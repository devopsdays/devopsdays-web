Manager of Development Enablement

I am passionate about inspiring and supporting young women to pursue careers in STEM. My background is in Applied Mathematics, and yet my acting and theatre experience comes in handy more often than you’d think. In my free time I like to practice emergency preparedness with my Neighborhood Emergency Team (NET), play outside, and dance.
