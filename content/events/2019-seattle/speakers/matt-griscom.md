Matt Griscom has 30 yearsâ€™ experience creating software including innovative test automation, harnesses, and frameworks. Two degrees in physics primed him to seek the big picture in any setting. This comprehensive vision and a love of solving problems that are important yet challenging led him to create the MetaAutomation pattern language to address the quality automation problem space of the software business. Matt blogs on MetaAutomation, consults, and recently published his third book on MetaAutomation. He also hikes, kayaks, runs, helps run an awesome Toastmaster group, and lives with his wife and two kids in Seattle. Matt loves helping people be more effective in doing software quality and is available by email at matt@metaautomation.net.
