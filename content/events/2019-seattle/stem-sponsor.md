The DevOpsDays Seattle team is dedicated to supporting our community and promoting diversity.
We're offering three "gold" sponsorship packages for DevOpsDays Seattle at no charge. You'll be
able to show off the work you're doing to help others, raise awareness, talk to potential donors, or
attract volunteers.

The rules:

* You'll get everything listed for gold sponsors on our main {{< event_link page="sponsor" text="sponsor page" >}}
* These are "first come, first served" with a maximum of 3 spots available
* Must be a registered 501\(c)(3) non-profit or government organization dedicated to STEM education for under represented persons
* Must offer services in the greater Seattle area
* Must have people available to be at the sponsor table educating our attendees about your organization
* Must agree to comply with our {{< event_link page="conduct" text="code of conduct" >}}.
* We reserve the right to determine eligibility, and our decision is final

To apply for a spot, please send email to {{< email_organizers >}} with the name of your organization, a short
description, and a URL where we can learn more. 

We will respond as quickly as possible (we're all volunteers and sometimes get delayed by our "day jobs"). We
will update this page when all spots are spoken for.
