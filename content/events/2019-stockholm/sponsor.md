### About DevOpsDays

DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of technical conferences and it was held in Stockholm for
the first time in 2017. Following the success of previous conferences, we are proud to
invite you to DevOpsDays 2019 in STOCKHOLM.

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference and brings together practitioners and leaders
in Software Development and IT Operations to collaborate and learn from each other. It is
both a technical conference and a conference focusing on culture, processes and structure
within organizations. We encourage both technologists and business people to attend, learn
and share experiences. This unique mix of perspectives creates an atmosphere of
collaboration and learning not easily found at other conferences.

DevOpsDays is a single track conference, with curated informative talks in the morning,
and self-organized content in the afternoon.

The Stockholm charter of the Devopsdays conference ran successfully in 2017. For 2019 the
conference is now independent of any single company and fully run by a community of
volunteers.

### Become a Sponsor

As a self-organizing conference, DevOpsDays depends on sponsorships. By sponsoring
DevOpsDays you will get the opportunity to network and build relationships with highly
motivated developers, sysadmins, IT executives and managers within the burgeoning
Scandinavian DevOps community.

Our sponsorship packages are constructed to connect our sponsors directly with the
community to facilitate networking, branding, and talent recruitment. We encourage
sponsors to actively participate in the conference and engage with other attendees as
peers.

We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested, please email us at
