DevOpsDays are community-focused, self-organising conferences for devops practitioners that depend on sponsor support.  
However, because of the nature of the event, we do not have large vendor booths or book product pitches. 


Platinum & Gold sponsors get a table they can use for technical and promotional material for interested people to come visit during breaks. Attendees, including sponsors, are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and marketing may work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

* We do not offer speaker slots in return for sponsorship.
* We do not ever sell or provide contact details of attendees.


The best thing to do is send engineers, managers etc. to interact with the community at Devopsdays on their own terms.
