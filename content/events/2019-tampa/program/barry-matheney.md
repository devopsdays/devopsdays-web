How can you save your engineering team from the costly trials and tribulations that come with new software development efforts? The answer is simple: establish a sprint zero. Before your user stories are ready, your development team should build a Hello World app on every deliverable type for your target technology. Use “sprint zero” to deploy and deliver all of these artifacts in every target environment for the new solution - all the way through up and into production. Your first demo is the Hello World app from PROD. Once you’ve done this, the results will speak for themselves: your pipeline transforms into a runway for delivery rather than the sometimes experience plumbing that can go awry.
