You sometimes hear that DevOps and IT service management (ITSM)/ITIL® aren’t compatible. As a former Change Manager, I can see clearly that organizations that are successfully adopting DevOps practices aren’t achieving that success without ITSM. Nor do they become high performing with overly-rigorous ITSM processes. This is particularly true when it comes to the dreaded IT change management process. The key message of this ignite talk is that we can all agree on the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of the change management process. It’s the ‘how’ that must change.
