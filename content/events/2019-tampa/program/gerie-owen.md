Continuous testing is one of the most effective ways of building quality into the continuous delivery pipeline; yet it is difficult to implement in practice. It involves more than test automation. Although test automation is a must; continuous risk analysis and optimizing the test suite is critical so that the automated suites doesn’t become a bottleneck in the continuous integration pipeline. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to implement an effective continuous test strategy throughout the continuous delivery pipeline. We’ll look at real life examples of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll learn how to optimize test scope, test cases and test suites to create effective and efficient test automation. We’ll explore practices such as •	advanced analytics, •	environment access and availability, •	service virtualization, •	and data management and learn how to use them to enhance your continuous testing strategy. Finally, you’ll learn the importance of implementing production monitoring including automated test triggers, service health monitoring, test result monitoring and root cause identification. Attendees take home a clear understanding of how to plan and implement a successful continuous testing approach.
