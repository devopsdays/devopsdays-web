As technologists we know that the only constant is change. We are all also familiar with the rate of change, how quickly trends can come and go, and how difficult it can be to know which ones might stick.

Wardley mapping can help us make sense of this. It is a technique for developing situational awareness in a landscape buffeted by the forces of competition and evolution. Maps are not silver bullets; they donâ€™t predict the future. However, they can help us to identify where we are at, to see patterns, and to anticipate the types of changes that we will see in the future.

This talk will be an all too brief introduction to the concept of mapping so that you can decide if it is something that you would like to learn more about.
