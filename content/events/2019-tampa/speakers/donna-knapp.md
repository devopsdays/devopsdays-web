Donna is the author of The ITSM Process Design Guide: Developing, Reengineering, and Improving IT Service Management (which serves as the foundation for the Certified Process Design Engineer qualification), as well as two college textbooks, A Guide to Service Desk Concepts, Fourth Edition and A Guide to Customer Service Skills for Service Desk Professionals, Fourth Edition.

Donna recently teamed with Mike Orzen (co-author of Lean IT) to develop a Value Stream Mapping for Facilitators course and is also a member of the ITIL® 4 examination panel. Donna is a huge fan of W. Edwards Deming and is so notorious for evoking his wisdom that she has her own drinking game (#donnasaiddeming). As a citizen of Oldsmar, Donna also takes great pleasure in knowing that the founder of her town – R. E. Olds – was talking about ‘flow’ way before we were all born.
