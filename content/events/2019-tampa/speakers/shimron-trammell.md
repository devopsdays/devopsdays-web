Professionally I’ve been doing high-level DevOps now for more than 10 years. I’ve done release engineering, system administration, operations, and development work. I’m currently at InComm trying to build a Site Reliability team to do even more advanced things.

I am a tinkerer. I have a weird obsession with NBA basketball, Comic Books, Wrestling, and Law & Order. Born and raised in Michigan. I am a fan of all Detroit teams till the day I die.
