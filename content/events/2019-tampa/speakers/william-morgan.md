Hey, I’m Will. I’m a 25 year old Software Engineer who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work at Nielsen in Tampa, Florida and can’t get enough of the weather there! I love cooking amazing food, drinking wine, playing golf and watching the Office on repeat. You’ll always find me listening to EDM in my airpods (yes I’m an Apple fanboy) and I love basketball (Go Warriors!) and football (49ers are life).
