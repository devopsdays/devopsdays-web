DevOps is an important part of every tech organization, it is an enabler for creativity and productivity. Like many enabling technologies, DevOps is great when it just works. Developers and product manager should treat DevOps like running water or electricity - think about it as a transparent layer that empowers the business. In this talk Amir Shevat, an ex-Amazon and Google executive, will talk about how his startup is trying to build such a transparent DevOps layer, the technical and product challenges they faced, the architecture decisions that had to be made, and the learnings they had.
