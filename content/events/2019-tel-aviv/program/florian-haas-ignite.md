Managers have five important core responsibilities, which everyone in 
our industry tends to agree on. In no particular order, we can summarize 
them as

- be accountable and responsible for their team's actions,
- provide direction and guidance to their teams,
- act as an interface to other teams,
- care about the people on their team,
- deliver the team's product or service.

Most people appear to agree that in order for a manager to meet these 
responsibilities, the maximum team size under which that is 
realistically possible is about 10. Frequently, particular in 
organizations that pride themselves on their "flatness", that team size 
is routinely exceeded.

This is unspeakably, ludicrously wrong, and runs a high risk of manager 
burnout and team failure.

This talk makes a case for a maximum team size of 5.
