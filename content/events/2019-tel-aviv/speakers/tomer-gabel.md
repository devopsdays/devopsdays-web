A programming junkie and computer history aficionado, Tomer's been around the block a few times before settling in at WeWork. Over the years he's built any number of (predominantly back-end) systems, cofounded two major Israeli user groups (Java.IL and Underscore), organized an annual Scala conference (Scalape√±o) and is a recurring speaker at software conferences. He secretly still hopes to realize his childhood dream of becoming a lion tamer.
