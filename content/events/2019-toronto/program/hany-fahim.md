Errors can be a source of stress in our professional lives. More often than not its discovery can cause us to drop what we're doing to investigate. As an Ops person, I've come to accept errors as fact of life, and even come to appreciate them. Knowing your errors can help you pinpoint the source of the problem quickly. Over the years I've compiled a large list of helpful (and not helpful) error messages. This session goes through my favourite ones, along with interesting tales of troubleshooting and resolutions.
