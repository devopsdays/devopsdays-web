Teams are moving further away from the traditional “find it and fix it” method of handling how systems fail. In this talk we’ll take a look at how the SRE movement in technology is looking to reduce toil for teams and making their lives in “On-Call” more reasonable.

Thanks to conversations I’ve been able to have with the podcast, “On-Call Nightmares” I have been able to collect a number of data points to look at the impact of toil and what it does to people on an individual level.

This talk will discuss how teams define:

- Toil
- It’s impact
- Budgeting time
- Tools to help identify toil

Attendees will walk away with a greater understanding of what toil is in the world of distributed systems and how they can work to reduce it within their workplace.
