This talk will introduce "Prime Radiant", a self-serve dashboard (think "internal Heroku") that empowers teams to build and operate production systems at Flipp. In this session, I will discuss how Prime Radiant helped Flipp move from Monoliths to Microservices, and how a childhood lesson of mine underpinned its design philosophy.
