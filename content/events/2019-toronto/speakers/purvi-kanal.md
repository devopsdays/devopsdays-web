Purvi wants to live in a world where education is free, accessible and practical. She is the director of software development for Bridge; a Canadian non-profit teaching free, advanced programming and design to women, agender, and non-binary professionals in Toronto. Purvi created and taught the front-end curriculum at Bridge, and now oversees all the students and volunteers involved in the software development cohorts.

Purvi is also a solutions architect at Rangle, working as a full stack developer. She has been making web and mobile apps at scale for several years. When sheâ€™s not coding, you can find her playing Dominion and other board games, knitting in the summer to prepare for winter, and binge watching television without a trace of shame.
