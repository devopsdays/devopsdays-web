I’ve worked in the IT community for over 10 years, including as a database administrator and a DevOps / Cloud / Infrastructure engineer. I was a core contributor to Stark & Wayne’s SHIELD project, which adds backup functionality to Cloud Foundry, as well as a technical reviewer for Learning Go Programming published by Packt Publishing. Currently I am the US Developer Advocate for Logz.io, driving DevOps community engagement. Outside of work I am a chapter leader of Girl Develop It’s Buffalo chapter to help women in the Buffalo community launch careers in development.
