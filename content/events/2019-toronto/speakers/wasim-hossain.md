I’m a software architect at TELUS digital, helping lead and enable teams to build exceptional digital experiences.

I work with other technologists, architects and leadership team members to develop strategies and implement solutions that drive forward TELUS’s digital vision. I also mentor the development teams and work with them to evolve their engineering practices.

In my spare time, I love to get involved with the great developer community in Toronto by attending meet-ups, giving talks and teaching at developer learning events.
