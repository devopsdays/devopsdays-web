Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["sonia-gupta"]
+++
As we become increasingly reliant upon digital infrastructure and software in all aspects of our lives, technologists hold the safety and well-being of humanity in our hands. In this talk, we’ll take a journey through the history of digital ethics and explore what it means for all of us as technologists today. We’ll also examine some of the technical and social aspects of maintaining an ethical infrastructure and software development practice. Knowing our history and current limitations will help us to ensure that we understand our obligation, as stewards of technology, to do no harm.
