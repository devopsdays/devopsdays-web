<td>Deliver Business Value Through Code - These days, you probably have a mix of manual and automated processes with endless choices; and the DevOps thing just didn’t seem to catch on like you thought it would.

<td>11:00 - 11:50 - Saanich Room </td>
<td>Fawzy Manaa</td>
<td>The DevOps First Amendment - As DevOps is gaining traction in the enterprise, there’s an influx of bad DevOps execution in the name of DevOps principles. From overly restrictive pipeline patterns to blocking developers from experimentation and self-enablement, new capabilities are built, but the spirit of DevOps is sacrificed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11:00 - 11:50 - Oak Bay</td>
<td>Neil Peterson</td>
<td>Deployment and management in the age of cloud distributed applications - Application architecture is evolving to include managed cloud services.

<td>Double, Double, Toil and Trouble! Top SRE Practices for DevOps - Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) originated at Google as a discipline and set of practices to operationalize and scale its services. We will outline how to form an SRE discipline and explain the top SRE practices teams can adopt to operate their services. SRE is NOT operations as usual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>14:30 - 15:30 - Saanich Room</td>

<td>Moving Gov't Support Teams to SRE Practices, and Visioning to WardelyMaps - It isn’t the initial vision or employee skills that is wrong, it’s how the applications supported and evolve.

The Registry is breaking the cycle of build and replace by using WardelyMaps to manage the lifecycle and progression of services, while continuously improving via an SRE approach.</td>
