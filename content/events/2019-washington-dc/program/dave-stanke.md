All your tech is old. Even your new stuff is already old: somebody's already building something that's better. And they're probably going to give it away for free! So, what can you do about that? I have thoughts.

We all spend a lot of energy trying to discover tech debt, and eliminate it. Fat chance! In this talk, I will convince you that _all_ tech is debt, and that it's futile to try to live debt-free. Why? Because none of your tech is an asset; it's *all* liability. From the minute it's created, it's already old. It has security vulnerabilities. It's not idiomatic to whatever the latest trends are. It's eating you from the inside! So what can you do about it? Throw away as much as you can. Let someone else build the rest. And most importantly, focus on your real assets: your people, your culture, your brand. Your customers! Technologists are an asset. But tech? That's debt.
