Resilience Engineering (RE) is both multidisciplinary field of study as well as a community of practitioner-researchers from multiple high-tempo, high-consequence domains such as aviation, medicine, power distribution, space operations, and critical infrastructure. In recent years, the world of software engineering and operations has become involved and more acquainted with this almost 20 year-old field and community. This talk will give a "lay of the land" on what RE is, what it is not, what efforts are relevant to the DevOps community, what attendees can do to learn more.
