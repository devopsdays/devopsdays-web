Writing code is like learning how to ride a bike.  Once youâ€™re good at it, you never really forget the skill.    After having a 30 plus IT career starting as a programmer writing in assembler and Fortan, then moving up the ladder to be a systems analyst, systems designer, dba, project manager, and then an enterprise manager, taking the opportunity to try IOS app development was a little scary, but a lot of fun.

I will share some key lessons learned when developing a IOS prototype that is now being used as a basis for an app that is estimated to save over 16 million dollars for one federal agency.
