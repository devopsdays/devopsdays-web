In October of 2018 a redesigned site for supporting the mission of Recreation.gov went into production. This new system was built from the ground up to provide the best user experience for anyone to safely and sustainably experience some of the United States most prized national treasures. Reservations for campsites at Yosemite National Park, permits to climb half-dome, and tickets to attend the Whitehouse Easter egg hunt are just some of the items for sale. Recreation.gov is home to over 3,500 facilities and 100,000 campsites around the country. 

In this talk we will review how Recreation.gov is architected and operated to achieve its goal of 99.9886% uptime for millions of yearly transactions. You can expect to learn how Recreation.gov is broken up into more than 40 microservices, all deployed to Kubernetes clusters hosted in multiple AWS regions using a continuous deployment model. Weâ€™ll also go over our top lessons learned on general microservice problems and specific issues with operating any complex reservation system at scale.
