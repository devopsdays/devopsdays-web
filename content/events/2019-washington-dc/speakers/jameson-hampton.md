Jamey is a non-binary adventurer from Buffalo, NY who wishes they were immortal so they'd have time to visit every coffee shop in the world. They're currently working as a professional plant-liker (and full stack Rails developer) for Agrilyst, a startup that's doing data analysis and crop management for indoor farms. Writing and reviewing comics is their side hustle! In their spare time, they do advocacy in the transgender community, make podcasts and zines, and spend as much time as possible in the forest.
