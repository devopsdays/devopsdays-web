Currently work for a CyberSecurity company building out Operations Centers and leading a Devops team for our Managed Defense Products.

In my volunteer capacity I provide guidance and planning for HopeOneSource's DevOps processes and assist in field outreach signing up our users. I also run a transit assistance program for refugee arrivals in Northern Virginia. And when not doing that, I am a core organizer for SanctuaryDMV which provides accompaniment and representation for immigrants in our community as they navigate the court systems.
