Judy has been a software engineer for [many] years, and has been at Onyx Point since 2015. She has also functioned as a System Engineer, Project Manager, ScrumMaster, and a record store clerk. She was lucky enough to have started programming in the 19XXes when her Dad brought home a PDP-8. When not at work, Judy can be found baking treats, attending hockey games and rock concerts, or trying to finish a good book. Judy also loves to volunteer, especially in events that promote diversity in tech. Proof of her dedication to this cause is the fact that both of her awesome daughters are engineers.
