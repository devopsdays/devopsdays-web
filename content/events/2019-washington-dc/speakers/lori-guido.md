Ms. Guido had a 30 plus IT career doing DevOps before it was called DevOps.  She started as a programmer writing in multiple languages, developing applications for vastly different projects.  Then she moved up the ladder to become a systems analyst, systems designer, dba, project manager, enterprise manager, and finally vendor manager.  Near the end of her federal career, Ms. Guido jumped at the opportunity to be an IOS app developer showing you can switch careers/technologies successfully.
