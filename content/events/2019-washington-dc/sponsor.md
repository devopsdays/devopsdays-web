DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends
on your sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations,
or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have
short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the
website and social media before, during, and after the event. Sponsors are
encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with
the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demonstrate
products or projects as part of an open space session.

The best thing to do is send practitioners to interact with their peers at
DevOpsDays on their own terms.

Early [sponsorships are available
now](https://devopsdaysdc2019.busyconf.com/bookings/new?discount=SPONSOR).
These sponsorships are being made available before the date and location of
DevOpsDays DC have been confirmed.  We are targeting June, 2019 for the
conference but there are no guarantees that we will find a [location that
meets our criteria](/events/2019-washington-dc/location/) with availability.

Please email the organizers at {{< email_organizers >}} with any questions
you may have about sponsoring the event.

The following chart outlines our sponsorship packages.

<p>
  All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open
  spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will
  probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the
  attendees.
<p>
  The best thing to do is send practitioners to interact with their peers at
  DevOpsDays on their own terms.
