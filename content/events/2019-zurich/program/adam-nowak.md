In the early days of Netguru, we were a bunch of developers and didn’t even think of
having a dedicated ops role - life was simple and easy. The company grew, so did our
requirements and challenges, and that’s why we’ve decided to change this by introducing
The DevOps Team. That’s also how we’ve entered a very dangerous path with a lot of
obstacles related to technology, people, and culture.

This presentation is about real scenarios which we’ve encountered and the way we handled
them. This is a story about money, expectations, tickets, sweat, and long hours spent
making everybody happy. If you’re thinking of hiring a “DevOps Specialist”, then this
talk is just for you. Don’t wake up one day and realise that there’s a team in your
organisation which takes your focus and energy in the wrong direction.
