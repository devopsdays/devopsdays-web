AIOps is one of the most promising fields where machine learning and in particular deep
learning is starting to play an increasingly dominant role. Besides streamlining different
tasks, machine learning algorithms are able to give additional insights into complex
business processes, which most often cannot be maintained anymore by a human being without
automation. One of the reasons is the number of interdependent system components which
interact with each other in order to fulfil a certain task.

In this talk, I will show how a specific data representation, namely Knowledge Graphs, can
help in order to speed up and optimise different areas within the field of AIOps. Several
hands-on examples will be shown and an outlook will be given what other impacts will be
generated by AI research in the AIOps community.
