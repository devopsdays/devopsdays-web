Traditional “Ops” tasks such as provisioning VMs in on-premises data centers,
configuring load balancers and firewalls, performing manual deployments, or configuring
application-level monitoring and alarming are subject to significant automation efforts
by many companies. On top of that, modern public clouds such as AWS, Azure, or OCI provide
a plethora of tools and features that aim at increasing IT productivity even further. More
precisely, (cloud-based) automation reduces the human resources needed to run and
maintain software. Are we evolving from DevOps to NoOps?

This talk aims at answering this question by discussing a selection of the most important
established (e.g., Kubernetes) as well as prospective (e.g., serverless) cloud-based tools
and techniques. For each presented technology, the talk draws conclusions on what DevOps
skills will gain/loose importance in the future. Finally, the talk combines the individual
results and presents a “cloud-native DevOps engineer” profile.
