Cloud solution architects and DevOps engineers want to have a faster conversion from idea
to product. What if there would be a way to draw an architecture online and get the
infrastructure for it implemented as code automatically. This is the reality.

During the talk, I will demo how it is possible to create AWS architectural diagram in the
browser and get it converted to working Terraform configurations and show it all in action.

Keywords: Terraform, terraform-aws-modules, modules.tf, open-source
