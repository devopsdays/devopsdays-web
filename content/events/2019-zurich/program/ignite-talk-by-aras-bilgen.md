I wish adopting DevOps was as easy as just ticking items off on a DevOps todo list. Or as
easy as setting up Jenkins and Docker. The reality is very different. Successful DevOps
transitions require changes in the technical stack, in the mindset, in practices, and in
the organizational culture. Unfortunately, the key cultural elements that need to change
are usually buried in apathy, shyness and office politics.

To reveal these crucial yet hidden cultural elements, we borrowed methods from an unlikely
discipline: Design. User experience designers have been using human-centric methods to
better understand human needs for more than 40 years now, producing digital experiences
that transform many areas of our lives seamlessly. We brought a selection of these human-
centric design methods to the IT department to understand how our clients work and to hear
their deep, unspoken needs.

Join us to see examples from our work and hear five underlying principles that helped us
see unique cultural perspectives in technical organizations.
