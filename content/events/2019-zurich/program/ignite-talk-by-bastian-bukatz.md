I made mistakes and had experiences of success in over ten years leading Dev and Ops
Teams, building DevOps Teams and coaching Companies within their DevOps Journey.

I want to present my experiences as well as Dos and Don&#39;ts I derived for myself.
Questions I focus on are:

- How to support people in taking more responsibility?
- How  to support engineers in being more curious about new technologies and ways of working?
- Automation in a legacy environment, is it worth it?

The goal of the talk is that everybody in the audience, if she is in a leadership,
engineering or coaching role, can take at least one behavioral pattern and try its
application in his daily work.
