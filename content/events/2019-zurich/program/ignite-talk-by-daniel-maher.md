What is time? Is it fixed or fluid; physical or philosophical; quantifiable, or completely
questionable? These deep questions may never be answered, but one thing is clear: the
measuring, recording, and interpretation of time is a fundamentally important mission for
humanity. In the modern age of computing, the accurate reckoning of time across cities,
countries, and even planets is performed by a fantastic patchwork of actors - from
governments and corporations, to academicians and hackers of all colours.
In this ignite presentation, we’ll explore some of the different ways time is measured,
look into the real-world ramifications of time reckoning on the Internet today, and even
have some fun with time zones, broken datetime libraries, corrupt nation-states, and a
bunch of charts, graphs, and maps.
