Infrastructure-as-code and cloud platforms enable the definition, configuration and
automated provisioning of infrastructure using code. Practices like version control,
four-eyes principle, test automation, staging environments, deployment pipelines and
investing in observability bring with them the confidence and speed to deliver
infrastructure changes into production continuously.

In this lightning talk, I would like to highlight some approaches that have proven
themselves in practice, and how infrastructure changes can be brought into production
continuously by using test automation and pipelines.
