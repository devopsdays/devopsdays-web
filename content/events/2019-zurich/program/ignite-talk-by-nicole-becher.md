API’s are everywhere!

We are living in the API Economy. Learn about the unique security challenges that exist in
API-driven applications. In this talk, we will explore security vulnerabilities I've seen
from pen-testing API’s, how to hack them and how to implement countermeasures to help
developers to protect them.

API security is becoming an important topic with developers, DevOps and DevSecOps alike.
Whether its communicating with other microservices, containers, cloud services,
applications or data stores, API’s are everywhere in a modern DevOps stack.

This talk will explore the basics of an API and dive deeply into the security issues that
arise when developing API-driven applications. Some of these include how you can
fingerprint an API, manipulate REST methods, an overview of different types of API
authentication methods, such as Basic Authentication, Basic Digest, Session vs Token, JWT
and OAuth.

Learn some of the weaknesses in these authentication schemes such as overstuffing a JWT,
stealing an OAuth token and other attacks on the authorization flow.

We will also learn how the traditional web application security vulnerabilities can be
used over API’s, like cross-site request forgery (CSRF), cross site scripting (XSS) and
other injection attacks. Understand how to protect your API against availability attacks
such as brute-force and Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Many attacks will be
demonstrated live on intentionally vulnerable applications.
