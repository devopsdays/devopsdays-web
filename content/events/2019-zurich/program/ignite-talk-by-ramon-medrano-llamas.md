SRE at Google uses an incident management protocol to manage outages of the complex
distributed systems we manage. These are stressful times that involve a fundamental human
factor, when many people can be involved and that the regular organisation might not help
unlocking the whole potential of the persons involved.

From psycological safety, to training and protocols, this talk is meant to discuss
