Raw engineering talent is important to achieve business and product needs; however, it is
also important to make space to improvement team dynamics in order to maximize the
effectiveness of individuals and maintain emotionally healthy working environments. One
tactic to achieve this is to organize team retros on a regular cadence.

Retros, when executed properly, empower individuals to give and receive blameless honest
feedback. Done wrong or not at all, resentment can build and lead to a toxic engineering
culture. In this talk, learn techniques to build inclusive environments, enable reflection
and open communication, and motivate teams to take action. Walk away with a plan for
implementing retros with your team. Take your first step towards continuous improvement.

This talk will be particularly beneficial to engineers who shape team dynamics or one in a
position to introduce a new process to a team. Depending on how one&#39;s team is organized,
this includes Product Managers, SCRUM masters, or an aspiring team lead. Attendees will
learn what a retro is, and best practices for how to introduce, moderate, and follow up on
retros within their company.
