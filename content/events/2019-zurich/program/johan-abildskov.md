In the world of Agile and DevOps we use many figures, charts and diagrams to argue and
reason about our world and how we prioritize and make choices. You can't say Agile without
having drawn at least a few quadrants with axes scaling from "good" to "bad" or from
"good" to "could have been better".

Unfortunately many of these important visualizations are misunderstood at best and abused
at worst. We go through coming figures and check our cognitive biases. For each figure we
cover the misunderstanding, the consequence and ways to address this.
