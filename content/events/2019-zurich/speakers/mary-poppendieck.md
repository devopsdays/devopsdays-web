Mary Poppendieck started her career as a process control programmer, moved on to manage
the IT department of a manufacturing plant, and then ended up in product development,
where she was both a product champion and department manager.

Mary considered retirement in 1998, but instead found herself managing a government software
project where she first encountered the word "waterfall." When Mary compared her
experience in successful software and product development to the prevailing opinions about
how to manage software projects, she decided the time had come for a new paradigm. She
wrote the award-winning book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit in 2003 to
explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software
development.

Over the past several years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches
classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book,
Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, a third, Leading
Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009, and a fourth book, The Lean
Mindset: Ask the Right Questions in 2013. A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to
bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development.
