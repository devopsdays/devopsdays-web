Organisations put security as an after thought when implementing DevOps. April will walk you through the transformational changes that occur to teams and how they deploy their code and infrastructure in a DevOps positive organization. The focus will be on making security at the forefront of your code, not leaving it to be an after thought. How the most successful DevOps organizations are able to do this successfully and enable your organization to do the same. We will discuss not only how to make all teams security aware, but what tools and methods are available.
