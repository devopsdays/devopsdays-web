Every developer needs to know how to write secure code. As the world becomes more digital, security is becoming increasingly important.
HackerOne is a company with a community of over 700,000 hackers, who report security vulnerabilities on their platform. Having that many hackers so close to potentially critical (and valuable!) information means that keeping the HackerOne platform secure is of the utmost importance. Over the years, HackerOne has implemented different methods of promoting
secure coding practices and ensuring platform security at different stages of the devops lifecycle.
In this session, Karen will show you how HackerOne has embedded security and writing secure code into their organization’s devops lifecycle using over 25 methods, and how you can apply these to your organization. She will cover both tooling and developer best practices. If you are interested in writing secure code or promoting secure coding practices at your organization, you won’t want to miss this talk!
