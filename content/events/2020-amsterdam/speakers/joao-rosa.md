João Rosa is a Strategic Software Delivery Consultant at Xebia, since June 2018, where he helps organisations to move to new organisation models. In our industry, it is also known as IT transformations. I’m involved on some of those transformations, ranging from Agile, cloud or DevOps. I act as an advisor for senior/middle management regarding the technology strategy to achieve the organisation goals. My main focus is to aid the organisation to adjust the management behavior towards leadership practices; it fosters an engineering culture, where the organisation can move towards a new operating model. I can act as interim-Engineering Manager (or CTO, Director of Technology depending on the organisation). João before that worked at Coolblue as their Technical Team Lead. He's the co-organizer of the DDD Nederland and Visual Collaboration Tools Netherlands meetups.
