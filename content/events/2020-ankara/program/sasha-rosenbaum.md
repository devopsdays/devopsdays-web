“This will never work here” is the sentiment we often hear from companies just starting their DevOps transformation. The good news is that change is possible, and even 45-year-old companies can transform themselves! In this talk, Sasha will explain how Microsoft moved from the 3-year waterfall software delivery cycle to deploying multiple times a day!
 
Using the example of the live engineering environment for Azure DevOps Services, Sasha will walk through the process of updating older systems, transforming the automated tests and implementing CI/CD. Sasha will also discuss how Microsoft embraced open source and GitHub, and walk through the major cultural changes that made this transformation possible.
