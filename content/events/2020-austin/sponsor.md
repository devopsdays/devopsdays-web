In past years, sponsors have inquired about using the luxury boxes within the venue for discussion areas, consulting / solution areas, and similar uses. This year, we are opening up opportunities for sponsors to utilize the rooms. These boxes are located upstairs of the main stage area - in the same "loft" space as the Open Spaces part of the program. 

The rooms will be set up with tables and chairs. Sponsors can put standup signage around the outside and set up tables for demos / displays. Everything must fit and be free-standing - nothing can go on the walls / ceilings.

Platinum sponsors will have access to the rooms all day on both days and are free to schedule activities at any time during - as long as those events stay within their room and are publicized by sponsors themselves.

Open Spaces events and Happy Hour are scheduled in other rooms in the same upstairs area, but there are no DevOpsDays Austin events scheduled in the upstairs area during keynotes, talks, or meals.

### Lanyard Sponsor ($5000)

What better way to get your branding in front of attendees than to have everyone carrying it around attached to the one thing they absolutely must have, their badge?  We only have one lanyard sponsor, and they get their logo (co-branded with the DevOpsDays logo) on all the lanyards for the event.  DevOpsDays Austin takes care of making and distributing the lanyard.

Lanyard sponsorships come with two complimentary event tickets.

Gold packages are the most popular DevOpsDays Austin sponsorship package.This is the package with a table in the vendor area of our event. We locate food service in the sponsor area and otherwise take effort to drive attendee foot traffic into and through the area.

Please be aware these are not full conference booths like at a major tech conference - no backdrops, things fastened to the ceiling, etc. can be accommodated.  You can bring a tablecloth / table cover and will have room behind your table for a couple people and stand-up sign banner or two.  Each table has a power strip to it and a couple chairs. The Gold sponsorship comes with four tickets.

Gold sponsors also get comprehensive branding and shout-outs throughout the show, and have the opportunity to do one minute pitches to the full conference audience between the all-hands sessions.

Silver sponsorship packages are designed for sponsors who do not want to staff a table, but who would still like to sponsor the event and have prominent branding. The silver sponsorship receives access to put materials on unattended tables shared with the other Silver level sponsors of the event along with brand inclusion on conference slides, signs, website, and social media.

A Silver sponsorship comes with two complimentary event tickets.
