      <p><a href="http://bit.ly/corona-austin" class="btn btn-danger btn-block">Devopsdays Austin Health Statement</a></p>
      <p>Each day starts with two keynotes and then three content tracks of expert talks in technology and tech culture. This year we've added two tracks of hands-on workshops as well. After lunch we have a series of lightning talks and then self-organize a series of small groups called openspaces. In these openspaces, attendees share and discuss their knowledge on a specific point topic of interest.  Youâ€™ll find many opportunities to participate, engage, and discuss with your peers at DevOpsDays Austin!</p>
