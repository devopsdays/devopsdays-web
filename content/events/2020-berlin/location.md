Located along Friedrichstrasse, within walking distance of the Brandenburg Gate, and of Museum Island and close to the central railway station, the Kalkscheune Centre provides setup and seating for our DevOpsDays Berlin. Varied rooms in a landmarked building and a green inner courtyard provide a very special framework for our event.
