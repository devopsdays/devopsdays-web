Ana is a Chaos Engineer at Gremlin in San Francisco, CA. She started her coding career as a middle schooler doing freelance work, went on to land paid engineering internships throughout high school and college, and eventually dropped out to work full-time in Silicon Valley. Prior to Gremlin, she last worked at Uber where she was an engineer on the SRE and Infrastructure teams specifically focusing on chaos engineering and cloud computing.

Originally from a Nicaraguan family, Ana was born in Costa Rica and later moved to the United States where her tech development took off in Miami. Her achievements have been a result of her persistence in not taking no for an answer and always finding a solution. As a Latina, she is breaking the glass ceiling within Silicon Valley and using her voice to encourage women in Hispanic/Latinx communities to learn how to code.
