On Dec 10, 2019, I participated as a speaker at the GlobalSKILupDay Organized by DevOps Institute. The title of my conference was “HOW TO ACHIEVE AGILITY USING TOC (Theory of Constarints) – LEAN – DEVOPS”.

I have a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the IDE Business School in Ecuador and another Master's Degree in Information Technology Management from the Polytechnic of Madrid Spain.
