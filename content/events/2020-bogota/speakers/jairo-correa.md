I'm a Senior DevOps Consultant at Endava. I come from a Pre-DevOps world and had experience in Configuration Management, Release Management, Build & Deploy Management, and Testing. Then everything I was trying to do made sense when I found about and Continuous Delivery and made it my religion. I worked several years at IBM and evangelized DevOps as much as possible. I also experienced the evolution of AI and Cognitive Computing, and became passionate to use every bit of technology on reach to put into my daily work, and I'm always looking for new ways to automate workflows and reduce human error. Yeah, I remember the times before Siri, Jenkins and Docker.

I'm passionate about literature, soccer, Star Trek, DC comic books, playing drums, and binge-watching Netflix series. I haven't seen a single episode of Game of Thrones. My best gadget is my kindle. I actually don't know the first thing about One Direction.
