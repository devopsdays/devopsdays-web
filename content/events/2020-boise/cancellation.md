Every year, we look forward to connecting with our local DevOps community at DevOpsDays Boise. Sharing and learning from experts in our community, and working with DevOps thought leaders that visit our event. But given the growing concerns around COVID-19, we've made the difficult decision to cancel Boise DevOpsDays for 2020 due to the uncertainties of having a large event gathering.

Canceling the event was a tough decision to make. We have thoroughly enjoyed planning DevOpsDays Boise, and itâ€™s one of our favorite ways to engage our local community. However, we need to prioritize the health and safety of our Community, Organizers, Sponsors, and everyone who helps make Boise DevOpsDays great. We have made the decision to move the event to *April 6-7, 2021*, and make it a two day more robust event. We made this decisions based on the unknowns of the current situation.  

Those of you who have registered for DevOpsDays Boise, can either have a full refund, or hold your ticket for the two-day event next year.  
 
We would also like to thank our Sponsors, Cradlepoint, In Time Tec, Balsam Brands, Simplot, Chef, and Intuit for being fantastic community supporters. We look forward to an exciting event in 2021.
On behalf of the DevOpsDays Boise organizing committee: thank you for being a part of the local DevOps community!
