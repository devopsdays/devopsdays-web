In this workshop we'll cover the main aspects of handling the large tech company interview process. The core of this being the System Design interview and the Coding interview.

First we'll cover how to prep for interviews, resources, and time allocation. Along with what you should expect throughout the process.

Next we'll cover the solutions to a few common coding interview questions, with a little theory along the way. We'll walk through PHP code examples that solve FizzBuzz, 8 Queens, and a Quicksort implementation.

Then we'll work through different system designs and architecture decisions for building a large scale PHP application. We'll start with small systems and iteratively build upon them until they are truly web scale.

We'll finish up by discussing what to do once you receive an offer and how to negotiate.
