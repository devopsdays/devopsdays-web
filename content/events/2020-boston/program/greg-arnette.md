Configuration is moving to the edge.

System components are becoming more decoupled, with substantial portions of the infrastructure config being embedded inside their source repositories.

This more distributed and decentralized definition of the system improves iteration speed and maintenance concerns (application developer wins) but also increases the difficulty of managing the cross-cutting concerns of the organization like security, compliance, and reliability (DevOps losses).

In this talk, we will discuss why cloud configuration management needs to adjust to handle these competing tensions.
