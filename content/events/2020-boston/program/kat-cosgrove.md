Devices on the edge are hard to update. The process is often clunky, slow, and inconvenient. So what’s making them harder to deal with than other machines, and how do we design a system that mitigates the problem when we’re dealing with such a wide range of hardware configurations and capabilities?

There is no one-size-fits-all solution (yet!), but we do have some tools and techniques at our disposal that make the process a lot less painful and a lot more safe. To prove it, we built a concept system using the biggest, flashiest example of an edge device we could think of -- a car.
