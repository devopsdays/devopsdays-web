In our quest to secure all the things, do we jump in too quickly? We'll use Istio and Linkerd as example service meshes, and look at the features we would expect from a service mesh. We'll dive into the day-1 experience with both Istio and Linkerd, and some advanced scenarios of using the service mesh. We'll compare this to border security with an app gateway, and compare and contrast the security features, complexities, and implementation costs. You'll leave with a concrete understanding of the benefits and tradeoffs you get when you pull in a service mesh, and be ready to justify the investment.
