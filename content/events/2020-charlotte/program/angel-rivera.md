Title = "Apps, Stacks, and Frameworks: Avoiding “Shiny Object” Syndrome"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["angel-rivera"]
+++

Technology is fast moving, and devops tools pop up like wildfire. Teams are desperate to solve their problems & often make implementation decisions based on word of mouth, “kick the tires” syndrome or superficial evaluations. In some cases we justify our stack decisions based on project/sprint deadlines, the product’s marketing materials, occasionally, the README files. Really scary stuff!

In this talk Angel will explore how & why teams are easily lulled into believing that shiny objects will independently solve their stack deficiencies. He will discuss his experiences with “Shiny Object” frameworks/tools and the true impact they had in actually solving problems. He will also discuss some strategies that can help teams make better choices when properly vetting potential solutions based on his experience in the federal government evaluating vendor proposals and homegrown solutions.
