We’ve been conditioned over the years to always question whether we can succeed. We tend to focus on all the things that could go wrong instead of the possibilities. The attitude of being ready to work even in the face of challenges and despite odds is what will make all the difference in your life. In this session, you will learn how changing your narrative and focusing on what is possible can have a dramatic effect on both your success at work and your happiness in life.
