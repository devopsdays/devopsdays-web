We talk a lot about creating a DevOps culture within an organization. While this conversation usually focuses around technology and delivery challenges, it also helps to look more broadly at how to create a culture of inclusion. When I think about a culture of inclusion, I imagine organizational customs, beliefs, and actions that truly honor and welcome all individuals. To me, such a culture encompasses a multitude of factors, including race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, mental health, religion, ethnic and cultural background, and socioeconomic status.

As a white gay dad to two kids of color and as someone who used to do diversity training for a living, I’m acutely aware of issues of difference. My husband and I like to think we’re living in a bit of a safe bubble just outside of Boston, but racial prejudice and profiling happen everywhere. I feel that I have two important duties to my children in this regard. First, prepare them to live in a world where people will likely see and treat them differently because of the color of their skin. Second, do my small part to change that world – one person and one organization at a time.

In this talk, I’ll provide some ways you can help foster a culture of inclusion within your own organization. Whether you’re the token member of an underrepresented group or if you’re just trying to make your organization more welcoming, you’ll find some strategies you can start using today.
