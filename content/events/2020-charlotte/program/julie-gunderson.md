As the DevOps movement continues to see momentum many organizations still don’t know where to start. A common misconception is tooling will make you “DevOps”. While tools can give you software that will allow you to automate or continuously deliver or monitor, alone they won’t get you to necessary processes to take advantage of the benefits DevOps has to offer. In this talk attendees will learn why it’s the people that matter most and how to leverage DevOps best practices along with processes to make the most out of your DevOps journey.

Being a champion in the DevOps world means going beyond the win by delving deeper into the team/organizational structure and culture. By identifying outlying issues beyond tools, and then working with others to embrace necessary change, DevOps champions can lead the charge in organizational transformation and adoption of DevOps.
