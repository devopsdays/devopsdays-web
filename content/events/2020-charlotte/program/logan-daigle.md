Technology organizations have a lot of people that experience deployment or work pain and it comes at the cost of the physical and mental health. What can we do as a community and as leaders to help make sure that DevOps is inclusive of making sure that we talk more about a life work balance as opposed to a work life balance. How do we enable a community with a culture of personal well-being and health so that everyone can provide their best effort?

I come at this from the perspective of 10 years of being a work-a-holic, being a husband and father of 3 children, there is no work that is ever more important that being part of a family or a friend. I’d like to help people avoid the pitfalls I’ve walked into and that I commonly see in tech organizations.

What can we do from a personal perspective? advocate for ourselves to have guardrails to we can spend time with family, friends, or just on ourselves What can we do from a leadership perspective? set guardrails for our work force that enables and empowers them to take the needed time to recoup their mental clarity What can we do from a coaching perspective? make sure that we are advocating for people to adopt the simplicity agile principle and make sure that they are doing what is valuable and necessary as work. Empower people to be able to say “no” and ask “why”.

I will dive into each of these questions to implore our community that focusing on personal health is beneficial to all of us! We will explore metrics that show how high performers achieve happy employees, what the opposite looks like, and prove why we need to prevent burn out of our work force.
