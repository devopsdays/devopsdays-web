The default Kubernetes secrets management uses base-64 encoding but it does not manage the lifecycle of sensitive data. How do we inject a secret from an external secrets manager into a Kubernetes application? In this workshop, we’ll cover some tools and patterns that will retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault and inject them into a Kubernetes application. We’ll discuss how each approach can limit the surface area for secrets injection and examine the retrieval of static and dynamic secrets.
