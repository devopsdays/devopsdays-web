Austin Parker has been solving - and creating - problems with computers and technology for most of his life. He is an Open Source Engineer at LightStep and maintainer on the OpenTracing and OpenTelemetry projects. His professional dream is to build a world where we’re able to create and run more reliable software. In addition to his professional work, he’s taught college classes, spoken about all things DevOps and Distributed Tracing, and even found time to start a podcast. Austin is also the co-author of the forthcoming book Distributed Tracing in Practice, available in early 2020 from O’Reilly Media.
