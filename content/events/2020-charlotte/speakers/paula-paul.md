Paula Paul is a Distinguished Engineer who helps organizations adopt cloud native technology and serves the community as an ABI Syster, diversity speaker, and mentor. Paula entered the workforce as a software engineer at IBM in the early ’80s, where she shipped her first product on magnetic tape. She’s shipped many software products since then, evangelized .NET with Microsoft, held executive positions in technology architecture and operations, and taught people of all ages to code. Paula is passionate about equal opportunities for technical literacy and enjoys (half) joking that Kubernetes reminds her of IBM/370 systems programming.
