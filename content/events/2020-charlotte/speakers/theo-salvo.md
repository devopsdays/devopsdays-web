Theo Salvo is a Container Specialist Solutions Architect with Amazon Web Services, where he evangelizes the use of containers both to customers and other AWS teams. He has worked in both management and engineering, across a number of IT technologies including network, load balancing, DevOps, and containers–but never limited to those. He believes that you have to understand your customer in order to better utilize technology, and has always “reached across the aisle” to build a better service. Nicknamed “Eppes” after Charlie Eppes from the TV series NUMB3RS because of the way he visualizes architecture.
