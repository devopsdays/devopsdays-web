<hr>

devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space/breakout session.
