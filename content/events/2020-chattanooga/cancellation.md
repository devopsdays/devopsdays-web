The devopsdays Chattanooga organizers have decided to cancel the devopsdays Chattanooga event for 2020. We did not take this decision lightly, and spent quite a bit of time discussing whether or not to hold this year's event. However, our attendees', speakers' and organizers' health and well-being are our top priority and for that reason, we made the decision to cancel.

We also discussed the possibility of making the event a virtual one, or doing an event during the spring, but felt like postponing the event until November 2021 would be the best option. 

If you're still looking for local events to connect with other devops practitioners, please consider attending the [ChaDevOps meetup](https://www.meetup.com/chadevops/), which is still occurring virtually. In the mean time, please continue to check back here, or follow us on Twitter for information about next year's event.
