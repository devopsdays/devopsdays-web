As applications become more distributed and complex, so do our failure modes. In this presentation, I'll share why you shouldn't just embrace failure, but why you should induce it to intentionally cause and learn from failure.

This presentation will start with some basic information on why you should start running Chaos experiments (sometimes called Game Days). I'll then share how to do it and include advice from running Chaos Engineering at Gremlin and Datadog. We'll end the session with a live, interactive Chaos experiment.

By the end of the session, attendees will be able to make a strong case to convince their managers of the value of Chaos Engineering and have the knowledge to be able to begin running Chaos experiments in their own environments.
