People are struggling with ways to reduce costs and still maintain developer throughput and velocity. Others might be in a place where they're looking at moving to the cloud or retooling their current cloud footprint. The goal of this talk is to show the audience how they can structure their environments, even if they're not currently looking at cost cutting measures. The approach will allow them to shift in a defensive spending posture, but limit the impact to development teams. The speed at which we were able to flip these switches allowed us to cut our spend by 30% within two weeks without reserved instances.
