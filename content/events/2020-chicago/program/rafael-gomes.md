Few sponsors, almost no money and a huge country. DevOpsDays in Brazil big cities are thriving, but what about smaller towns without tech communities? What are the challenges and achievements so far?

DevOpsDays in Brazil started 2010 in São Paulo, but they didn't organize it again in any city. We started back in 2016 in Porto Alegre and realized that we could help other cities to assemble too.

We started to help other cities with documentation, sponsors, contacts, tips, and money. Bras√≠lia happened in 2016 too. 

Here is the list of following years:

* 2017: Salvador, Brasilia and Porto Alegre
* 2018: Salvador, Feira de Santana, Belo Horizonte, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Belém, Florianópolis, Maringá, Porto Alegre, Santa Maria.
* 2019: Natal, São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Aracaju, Recife, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Feira de Santana, Florianópolis, Belo Horizonte, Belém, Campinas, Goiania, Brasilia.

The cities of the north had more difficulty to find sponsors and people to attend, but these events are helping the local community to grow. I will show some data related to this growth.
