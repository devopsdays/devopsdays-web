The year 2020 has been a year of trying times for us personally and professionally. Many companies have come face to face with adversity that is forcing them to reimagine their business and culture. These times require us to step up and be “Inclusive leaders”. This starts with creating a culture and space to have “Authentic Conversations”. This will be the start of what allows you to hear one another and develop solutions together. Lani has developed 6 steps to having an authentic conversation. Please join her as she takes you on a journey to strengthening your relationships one conversation at a time.
