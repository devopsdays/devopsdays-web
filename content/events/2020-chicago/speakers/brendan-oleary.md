Brendan has a passion for software development and iterating on processes just as quickly as we iterate on code.  He is a zealous advocate for the user experience. Brendan can still remember what his first computer - a Tandy 2000 - felt like to use (and break...sorry Dad). Working with customers to deliver value is what drives Brendan's passion for DevOps and smooth CI/CD implementation.  Brendan has worked with a wide range of customers - from the nation's top healthcare institutions to environmental services companies to the Department of Defense.  The only thing more eclectic is probably his taste in music.  Outside of work, you'll find Brendan with 1 to 4 kids hanging off of him at any given time or occasionally finding a moment alone to build something in his workshop.
