I was about 15 years old the first time I saw a computer, and I loved it! I joined a Math and Physics track in high-school, came to the US when I was 18 to attend ISU. I graduated with a CS degree and got a job as a programmer at State Farm.

Over the next 15 years, I went on to lead global teams as a consultant at ThoughtWorks, lead a team at Morningstar to deliver the CEOâ€™s highest-priority project, lead teams on critical safety projects as a Principal Consultant at Tandem, and co-founded my own consulting firm, Tested Minds. 

I have always enjoyed end to end project development, starting from scratch and taking it to production, seeing it in use, learning from the users, and constantly improving the product and the team. I enjoy all aspects of product development, but most importantly, I enjoy building teams and helping them to perform at their best. My strengths are leading application delivery teams, with full-stack expertise in Java, Ruby, Python and a few more. Let me know if I and the network of experts at Tested Mind could help you with your next critical project.
