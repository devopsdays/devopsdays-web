### Raffle Giveaways
DevOpsDays events **do not share attendee information with sponsors**.
  
We recommend offering a raffle prize to collect contact information voluntarily. Most attendees will not have business cards, so you’ll want to have a way to capture this information. 
  
This year we will do sponsors’ raffle prize giveaways between 1.50pm - 2.15pm on Day 2 while the organizers set up Open Spaces topics. Remember you may only announce your winner. No product pitches!


### Sponsor Pitch Schedule
Gold Sponsors have one minute to address the main hall and the listening audience during scheduled blocks between talks. Please ensure that the content of your pitch adheres to the Code of Conduct.   
This is a simple verbal pitch. No slides, banners, or other materials. We will display your company logo on the main screen during your pitch. Most folks mention their job openings/company overview rather than a product pitch.
