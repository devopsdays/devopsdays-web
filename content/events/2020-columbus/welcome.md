Due to the uncertainties of the unfolding situation which will likely impact our ability to provide a safe and healthy environment for our conference attendees, sponsors, and service providers, we have made the difficult decision to cancel DevOpsDays Columbus 2020 as it has been scheduled.
We are exploring alternatives, including rescheduling or re-casting the event in ways that will address our goals of networking along with information and knowledge sharing in a safe and effective way.  Stay tuned for more information to follow shortly.
