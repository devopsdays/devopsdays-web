  We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at
  [{{< email_organizers >}}].

  <hr />


  devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor
  booths,
  sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator
  pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the
  event.
  Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
  Any
  attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

  Gold and Silver sponsors get a full table and Supporter sponsors get a shared table where they can interact
  with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during
  the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when
  trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

  The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.

      <td>Who should I send to staff our booth?</td>
      <td>It is always good to have sales and marketing people on staff but also make sure to send your techy
        geeks that
        can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks. Sponsor personnel are encouraged
        to attend the sessions and participate in the group conversations and Open Spaces process as part of the
        community.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Will the event provide attendee contact information or badge scanners?</td>
      <td>No. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks. This conference is not a typical conference or
        convention. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and
        interact directly with the attendees. You are responsible to collect any info you want in person.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can we do a giveaway on stage?</td>
      <td>Yes. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (example: business
        cards, entry slips, etc.) for whatever drawing / mechanism you want to use. At the closing session, we will give you a
        short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?</td>

        booth!</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Do you provide flat-screen displays?</td>

        two weeks prior notice.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need graphics?</td>
      <td>You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on the table or behind it. Silver and
        Gold sponsors will have their logos rotating on available screens in the sponsor hall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How many people can we send?</td>
      <td>All sponsorship packages provide 2 ticket to the event, Gold Packages include 2
        additional tickets for a total of 4, any additional people you wish to attend, even solely to run your booth, must
        purchase additional tickets</td>

      <td>Yes, that is always our intent, always bring a backup device if you have concerns.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Do we get an ad in the program? When do you need graphics?</td>
      <td>When payment for your sponsorship is confirmed, we will need one logo graphic. That will be what we use
        in all materials.</td>

      <td>Do we get a dedicated email blast?</td>
      <td>No, but you will get a shoutout on social media for your sponsorship.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What are the demographics of the attendees?</td>
      <td>DevOpsDays Rockies typically attracts technologists, architects, and technology managers. These folks
        are attending to learn and to share learnings about the DevOps movement. They most appreciate sponsors who
        engage with them with that in mind.</td>
