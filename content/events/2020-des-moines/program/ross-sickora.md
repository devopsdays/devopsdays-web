After 7 years of working in different corporate settings as a software engineer, I thought I had a good picture of what DevOps looked like. Then I joined TractorZoom. Over the last 6 months I have learned more about DevOps and tech debt than I knew before I started.

In this talk I’ll share the lessons I’ve learned at a startup about how we overcame a mountain of tech debt to stabilize our platform and accelerate our ability to deliver features to our customers and how you can translate that to your enterprise’s challenges.
