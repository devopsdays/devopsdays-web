Chaos engineering is a disciplined approach to identifying failures before they become outages. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. Chaos engineering lets you compare what you think will happen to what actually happens in your systems. You literally break things on purpose to learn how to build more resilient systems.

In this session, Tammy leads a walk‑through of network chaos engineering, covering the tools and practices you need to implement chaos engineering in your organization. Even if you’re already using chaos engineering, she illustrates new ways to use it to improve the resilience of your network and services. She describes how other companies are using chaos engineering and the positive results the companies have had using chaos to create reliable distributed systems.

Tammy begins by explaining chaos engineering and its principles. She then asks why many engineering teams (including Netflix, Gremlin, Dropbox, National Australia Bank, Under Armour, Twilio, and more) use chaos engineering and how every engineering team can use it to create reliable systems. She shows how to get started using chaos engineering with your own team as you explore the tools to measure success and the chaos tools and new chaos features built into cloud services. She explains how to use wargame environments to learn about chaos engineering and how to practice chaos engineering on AWS DocumentDB, AWS DynamoDB, AWS RDS, and AWS S3.

Other topics include how to use monitoring tools combined with chaos engineering to help you create reliable distributed systems, where you can learn more, and how to join the chaos community.
