I have been an IT professional building software and information systems for over 22 years, from heads down developer to solutions architect, to manager of DevOps teams and partner in a few startups. I am passionate about cloud native and serverless development and prefer coding in C, C#, and Python. I assumed JavaScript would have been dead by now, but it has only gotten stronger, so I do that too but not out of love.

I currently hold the position as a Cloud Solutions Architect at Sogeti USA based out of Des Moines, IA, where I lead multiple DevOps teams for our clients in the Insurance, Financial, Government, Manufacturing, Agriculture, and Retail industries. I help source, assemble, mentor, and train team members on Cloud, software Development and DevOps concepts, tools and technologies, enabling the delivery of high-quality solutions for our clients.

I have a B.S. In MIS from Iowa State University and a M.S. Certificate in Information Assurance from Iowa State University
