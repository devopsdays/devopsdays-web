With a heavy heart, the organizers of Eindhoven would like to inform you that we have - at this time - decided to cancel devopsdays Eindhoven for 2020. We did not take this decision lightly, and we took a large number of variables into account. However, ultimately, the health and well-being of all of our attendees, speakers and organizers are our top priority.   

### What does this mean for you? 

For our attendees that have already bought tickets for the events, we will - of course -  be fully refunding your purchase. We will be issuing a full refund of the ticket purchase to the form of payment you used when initially purchased the ticket. Our Event Management Solution, Eventbrite, will send you a confirmation email of the cancellation & refund. Please note that the refund may take up to 14 days to process. 

### What if the situation changes?

When the current NL and global situation improves for the better in the months ahead, we will reassess the case, and if possible, put on an event later in the year. 

### What's next

Although this means no first devopsdays this year for Eindhoven, the organizers of Amsterdam and Eindhoven are busy thinking of ways to bend with the times and create an informative, vibrant, and exciting event online.
