Have you ever wondered why DevOps, Continuous Deployment, canary releases, microservices, chaos engineering and reducing Technical Debt work so well? Why it works at all? These and many other concepts all have one thing in common. They are affected by a hidden force: antifragility.

The word ‘antifragile’ did not exist until 2012 when Nassim Nicholas Taleb published his book titled ‘Antifragile, things that gain from disorder’. He defines antifragility as ‘anything that has more upside than downside from random events and shocks’. Ask yourself: does your organisation appreciate market shocks? Do your systems like random events? Probably not.
An antifragile system or organisation has the ability to become stronger as a result of unexpected events, malfunctions and errors.
In this talk Jan de Vries will explain the do’s and don’ts and why investing in antifragility pays off so much.
