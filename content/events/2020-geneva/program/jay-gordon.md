Many times the biggest ask for users trying to learn about containers is getting easy 'getting started' information. In this session attendees can get a getting started entry into building a Node.js 'Hello World' and bring it to production with only a few steps.

Many times the biggest ask for users trying to learn about containers is getting easy 'getting started' information. I recently presented at a conference where I showed attendees how to deploy a web application with Docker and Azure. A person who identified as a 'Junior Web Developer' confided in me with, 'I am so happy to see someone present this information in an easy method with the commands!' This confirmed that thereâ€™s still a big need to help users understand their first steps in taking the code they produce from their laptop and repositories up to the cloud.

In this session attendees can get a getting started entry into building a Node.js 'Hello World' and bring it to production with only a few steps. This session will provide the following steps to the attendee:

Cloning git repo with 'Code'
Building local Docker image, preview image
Creating Azure Container Registry, Authentication
Build and push to remote registry
Deploy container to Azure Web App for Containers (PaaS)
Attendees will be provided with demo code and instructions on how to deploy to production instructions (not necessary, only for further education).
