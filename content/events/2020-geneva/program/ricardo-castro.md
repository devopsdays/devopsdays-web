Logs are a critical part of any system, they give you deep insights about your application, what your system is doing and what caused the error, when something wrong happens. Virtually, every system generates logs in some form or another and  these logs are written somewhere, probably,  to files on local disks. When you're building large scale applications, your system goes to multiple hosts and  managing the logs across multiple hosts can be complicated. Debugging errors in such applications, across hundreds of log files on hundreds of servers, can be very time consuming and complicated. Without the right framework and tools, the debugging process can be a nightmare. How do you go about building a scalable logging platform that can evolve with your needs over time?
