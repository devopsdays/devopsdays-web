If 'DevOps' is anything, it concerns how we structure the various functions collaborating to manage information technology. Changing the organization of people to support high performance is one of the hardest and riskiest changes, but it can bring huge benefits.  Unfortunately, many people think there is such a thing as 'best' organizational structure. Or they believe that you can improve your structure by emulating some other organization. However, we benefit most from changes in organizational structure if we think of it in terms of a dialectic evolution responding to current issues, but also giving rise to its own new issues. This presentation synthesizes 25 years of experience with changing IT organizations - the good, the bad and the very ugly.
