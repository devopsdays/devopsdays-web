I am a DevOps/Platform engineer with a passion for everything opensource, automating the automation, and building maintainable  scalable infrastructure. My career started in Geneva, where I worked for Banque Pictet - and fell in love with the DevOps field. I then moved to London and am now part of one of the most exciting startups I've heard of - Babylon Health.
