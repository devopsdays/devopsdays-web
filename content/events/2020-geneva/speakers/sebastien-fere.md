Initially software architect in the Java/JEE ecosystem, I spent 5 years in the DevOps / DevSecOps areas addressing various concerns from the Software-Factory to Production. DevOps automation is of course at the heart of my expertise with tools like Jenkins, Atlassian, BlackDuck, SonarQube, Artifactory, Ansible, Docker, Prometheus, ... to name a few.

Over the last year, I spent much of my time building an enterprise Kubernetes / OpenShift platform including the CI/CD toolchain and preparing the CKA certification.

Hands on computer keyboards, feet in trail running and ski touring shoes, mind always looking ahead !
