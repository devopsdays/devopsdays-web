Dear {Name},

I’d like to attend to the DevOpsDays Guadalajara conference which is taking place on February 20th and 21st, 2020, in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

I’ve researched multiple IT events, and this is the first time in Mexico that a community-driven event gathers developers and IT professionals to share learnings, highlight innovation and discuss the future of cloud native computing, as well as emerging trends in microservices architectures and container orchestration with cloud technologies and many more.

This event is a great place to network with industry professionals and learn from experts. You can learn more about the conference here.

DevOpsDays Guadalajara offers open spaces, ignite talks and sessions that will allow me to build my knowledge on best practices and new trends in the rapidly evolving cloud native ecosystem.

I would be happy to write a post-conference report and share with other team members what I’ve learned, as well as how we can implement these cloud native tools and techniques into our business strategy.

Thanks,
{Your Name}
