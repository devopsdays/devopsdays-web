Here we address a problem that is more and more present in our everyday work life, remote teams. You may be the one working remote or the one working with someone who is at the other side of the world, it doesnâ€™t matter. The goal of this talk is creating conscience on how we can improve our communication skills, break the distance barrier and at the end of the day help our remote coworkers feel part of the team.
The main concerns this talk focuses on are difficult communication, motivation, time zones, among others. We will discuss these challenges, possible solutions and what we have done to promote remote working and break the distance barrier to prevent anyone feeling excluded or not being part of the team.
