After working on different projects I have seen some patterns for improving the team performance. Sometimes we just need five minutes to talk about them.

The ways

Write a team manifesto
Host 1:1s with everyone
Track everything
Continuous improvement in processes
Provide clarity
[Bonus] Handle developers pain
