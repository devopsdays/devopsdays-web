Extreme Blue is IBMâ€™s elite internship program. I was recently lucky enough to have my project proposal selected from hundreds of submissions to participate in the program. There was just one catch: my local Extreme Blue program had filled up and my project would be run out of the RTP lab, while I would be in Austin. The development cycle for the entire project is only 12 weeks long, consisting of on-boarding, five 2-week sprints, and a week for final presentations and transition. While I am no stranger to working with remote teams, doing so on such an expedited project was going to be a challenge, especially with 4 new interns unfamiliar with the project or the organization. Using a mix of Agile, Design Thinking, XP, and Scrum,  I was able to cut the cord and allow my team to run free with the project.
