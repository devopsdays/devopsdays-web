DevOps adoptions usually includes an evolution of processes and tool chains that enable these teams to function optimally. Modern day computing and infrastructure management is definitely shifting away from “ClickOps” management and adopting the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) way of doing business. IaC enables teams to easily define, deploy and maintain compute infrastructures in the form of code. It also provides the ability to effortlessly scale, version and audit infrastructure resources.

In this talk, attendees will gain a basic understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). They’ll be introduced to the core principles of IaC and have the opportunity to reinforce what they’ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring industry known tools such as Terraform and Pulumi. The workshop will demonstrate specifying, deploying and destroying a Kubernetes cluster via code. The participants will leave with a hands-on experience and understanding of what it takes to manage Infrastructure as Code.
