Enter progressive delivery, a set of techniques that allow you to balance the benefits of continuous delivery with the operational best practices that your operations team loves and your users deserve.

This talk will cover five important principles to help your team successfully implement progressive Delivery in a serverless environment. You will learn how to avoid the “gotchas” everyone runs into when implementing feature flags, canary analysis and progressive rollouts. Dan learned all of these by making mistakes in production, attend this talk so you don’t have to!
