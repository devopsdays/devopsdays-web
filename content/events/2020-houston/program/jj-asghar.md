In the modern day SDDC, the ability to create a VM or template consistent, repeatable, and streamlined is a requirement. Using open source projects like Packer, Ansible, and InSpec you can build this nirvana. Using Packer to create a template, Ansible to do your configuration management, and then trigger InSpec scanning of your compliance policies all on vSphere. In this talk, we will walk through the required foundational knowledge to build this pipeline. In this talk youâ€™ll learn:

* Overview of why creating pipelines is Important
* Overview of Packer, Ansible, and Inspec
* A demo of using the pipeline on the VMware on IBM Cloud
* Resources to start learning implementing portions for yourself
