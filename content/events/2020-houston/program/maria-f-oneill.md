The paths to DevOps transformation failure are more plentiful than the roads to success. As a DevOps
practitioner, you are passionate about change and familiar with the concepts, strategies and
professionals that can make DevOps happen. But one of the keys to a successful transformation is
executive buy-in and participation. How do you, as an engineer, talk to the CSuite?

In this talk, Maria Oâ€™Neill (CIO of the American Bureau of Shipping) will provide perspective on what a day-in-the-life of a CIO is like and more importantly provide perspective on how dumb the idea of DevOps can sound. As a leader, we must prepare our organizations for transformation before
transformation can truly take hold. In this presentation, Maria will break down the critical
considerations and talking points that must be part of your DevOps pitch to executive management.
