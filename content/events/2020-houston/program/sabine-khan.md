It is so easy to fall into the common trap of diving into a solution without understanding the problem first, even though this may result in sometimes creating solutions that were not even asked for. However this highlights the point that we still lack the deeper understanding of the problem, and that is where design thinking can supercharge your focus. The design thinking framework can encourage you to start with the user and work backwards. As a new successful strategy, Design Thinking has become a new approach to DevOps problem solving. You realize that the design, ideate, prototype, and testing phases can all occur within an automated DevOps pipeline. However, the one thing that we forget to realize is that empathy is what proves to be the real game-changer when mixing design thinking with DevOps. It might seem so simple to jump into the solution and doing proof of concepts before we can even empathize with all of our users. Let's discover how a design thinking mindset can also increase empathy within DevOps teams. How does the team develop a deep and meaningful understanding of how a user or customer interacts with their system and associated processes. After this session you will learn that people in operations who take a design thinking approach will consider what developers are trying to do, how they approach their work, and what they need to do their jobs more effectively.
