Dave has three decades of experience in developer tools, developer communities and evangelizing sustainable software delivery practices. Dave grew up just “off-campus” from Stanford as Silicon Valley morphed from defense to chips to software and finally internet services. Dave's front-row seat to those changes equips him with a unique point of view on the long arc and repeating themes of technology evolution.
 
As CD Evangelist at Split Software, Dave speaks on aligning progressive delivery (i.e. gradual rollouts of new code) with observability of system health, user experience, and user behavior. Before Split.io, he democratized "shift left" performance testing at BlazeMeter.
