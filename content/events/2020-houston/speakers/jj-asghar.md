JJ works as a Developer Advocate representing the [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) all over the world. He mainly focuses on the IBM Kubernetes Service and OpenShift trying to make companies and users have a successful onboarding to the Cloud Native ecosystem. He’s also been known in the DevOps tooling ecosystem and generalized Linux communities. If he isn’t building automation to make his work streamlined he’s building the groundwork to do just that.

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. A father and husband, trying to learn to balance his natural nerdiness with family life. He enjoys a [good strong dark ale](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/48/155/), [hoppy IPA](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2642/314808/), some team building [Artemis](https://artemisspaceshipbridge.com/), and epic [Gloomhaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) campaigning. He’s a member of the Church of Emacs, though he jumps into vim on remote machines.

He has recently dove headfirst into Fedora since IBM buying Redhat, but still secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere. He’s always trying to become a better web technology developer, though normally just uses bash to get the job done.
