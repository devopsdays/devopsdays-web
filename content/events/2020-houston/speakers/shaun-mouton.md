Shaun is a friendgineer working on the Chef Support team by day and hopefully asleep at night. He can most likely be found in Austin, Texas, reminiscing about a time when the most complicated thing folks would do with configuration management was make Nagios configuration less onerous. Shaun isn't a devops but can help sprinkle some on your infrastructure, apps, and/or culture. Friendgineering 4 lyfe, hugops not harm, [tirefi.re](http://tirefi.re/) benevolent underlord.
