    <p>We have taken the difficult decision to cancel DevOpsDays London for 2020. Our top priority is the safety of our attendees, our sponsors, and our team, and we feel that holding the event as planned with 400 attendees in person would not be a responsible action to take.<p>
    <p>We've also decided against holding the event virtually, as we feel like it wouldn't do it justice. Instead we will wait until 2021 with the intent to run an in-person event at the same time of year when it is again safe to do so. (Aiming for September)</p>
    <p>If you wish to contact us please email london@devopsdays.org.</p>
    <p>We hope to be able to see you all in person safely again soon.</p>
