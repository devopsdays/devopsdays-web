Have you ever wanted to move fast? but are to afraid too break too many things?. Learn from the experience of deploying the largest python site in the world, that also happen to do so every 7 minutes!.

This talk details the practical steps that we took to build our continuous deployment pipeline, We will highlight not only the technical challenges, and tools, but also the cultural philosophy need to make this happen, and how to actually deal when “break things” happen. These steps can be used by any development and infra team as blueprint towards a continuous deployment system.

Development and infra teams that already do some form of continuous deployment will identify with the problems and hear how we got to solve them, and move to the next stage. Others who did not already do so will hopefully be inspired to start when they learn that they can always start with the simple thing and progress step by step.
