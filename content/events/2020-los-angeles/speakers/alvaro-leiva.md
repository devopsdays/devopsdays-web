I love Coding, I grew up in a small town in Chile and one weekend, 16 years ago, I had the flu and could not go out. I decided to learn how to code in Python and that was the beginning of the road that would moved us all to the Northern California so that I could join the Production Engineering team at Instagram. Also like eating, drinking and cooking (in that order).
