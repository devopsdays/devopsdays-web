Ell Marquez has been part of the open-source family for a few years now. In this time, she has found the support needed from her mentorship relationships to grow from a Linux Administrator to an OpenStack technical trainer at Rackspace. Recently, she took the leap to join Linux Academy as a technical evangelist.
