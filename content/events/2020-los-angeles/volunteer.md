You do not have to be a speaker or organizer to participate in the LA DevOps community.
You can volunteer to help out at DevOps Day!

We need people of any background, i.e. graphic design, sponsor/speaker liaisons, greeters, etc.

Please reach out to us at {{< email_organizers >}}.

There may also be a SCaLE conference pass in to for you. ;)
