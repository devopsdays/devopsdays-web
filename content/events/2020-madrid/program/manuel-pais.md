Title = "The Elephant in the Kubernetes Room: Team Interactions"

Kubernetes helps us tame sprawling microservices architectures and addressing the increased operational complexity. Kubernetes gives developers abstractions and APIs to deploy and run their services.

Yet, the elephant in the room is that to run, maintain and evolve the Kubernetes clusters, we need more ops expertise and most likely a dedicated team to do so.

The question that begs to be asked is if we are going back to pre-DevOps isolation between Dev and Ops teams? Is the tradeoff between better operational tools and introducing a new dependency layer on the path for application teams to deliver and run their services worthwhile? Are we making life easier for application teams or instead reducing their end-to-end ownership?

Team Topologies is a structured approach for thinking about teams responsibilities and interactions which can help us get the most value out of Kubernetes adoption.

This talk draws on research and case studies from the Team Topologies book by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais (IT Revolution Press, 2019) together with first-hand consulting experience from the authors with organizations around the world.
