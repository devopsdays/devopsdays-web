Software developers have been testing their code for years. Why is it still not a common thing for infrastructure and operations people? We are in the era of having to move fast but, as this could affect our customers, it's vital that we ensure the changes we make to our infrastructure are tested like other code changes would be.

In this talk, Paul is going to demonstrate some of the methods of being able to test your infrastructure code. The talk will demonstrate how to have fast feedback loops in creating the code that will provision your infrastructure as well as being able to check that the code adheres to company policies and is deployed as expected.
