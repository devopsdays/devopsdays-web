Over an eight-month period, our organization formed a dedicated internal DevOps team. This team initially focused on fighting the fires currently in production and dedicated to improving the reliability of services in the company. The team’s focus was shifted from not just keeping things up, but eventually improving the experience for our own developers.

In this talk, attendees will learn about the cultural changes that took place going from reactive operations to being dedicated to improving overall reliability across the technology organization. We’ll look at some of the internal tools we've developed to reduce developer onboarding time and support toil. Automation related to provisioning resources and AWS accounts.
