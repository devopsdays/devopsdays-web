I work at Kuehne + Nagel for the Online Solutions department (KN FreightNet e-commerce Platform) in Hamburg since 2011. Originally from Venezuela, I joined as a software developer, but I’ve had the chance to try myself out in different roles during my time at the company so far. I’ve gone from pure software development, to a “mixed” role as developer/analyst where I took care of a lot of requirements engineering and coordination tasks, further to a “pure” analyst role with a sneak peek into agile coaching and back to the technical roots of my career now as an engineer in a platform/infrastructure team, working hard with my teammates to migrate our runtime architecture from VM-based to Container-based in a private cloud. I am moving in a world now where the best of my technical, analytical and communicational skills are needed. I am living a big challenge, but I am enjoying every step I take. I am passionate about continuous improvement and exchanging experiences with the tech community
