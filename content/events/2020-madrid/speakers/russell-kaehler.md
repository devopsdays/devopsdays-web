Grew up in Alaska. I did my undergrad degree in mathematics at the Evergreen state college. Masters in CS at the University of Montana. I've worked as a systems/infrastructure engineer for a little more than five years. In my spare time, I like to volunteer at a local bootcamp, Pursuit, which is dedicated to helping get more women and minorities into technology jobs.
