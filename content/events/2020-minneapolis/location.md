The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/airport">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. From there, you can walk (under a mile) or transfer to a free bus on Nicollet Mall in downtown. Rideshare services are also available.
