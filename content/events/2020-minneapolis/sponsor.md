These may be purchased in addition to (or in lieu of) the platinum, gold, and silver sponsorships in the prospectus. An à la carte sponsorship by itself does not come with a table; you must have a platinum, gold, or silver sponsorship to be assigned a table you can staff.

Devopsdays is a community-organized conference for practitioners. We keep costs low for attendees with the help of sponsors. Our global organization's [sponsorship guidelines](https://www.devopsdays.org/sponsor/) state that we cannot sell talk slots, nor can we distribute attendee contact lists. The greatest value in sponsoring is in directly interacting with local devops community members.

Our platinum, gold, and silver sponsorships offer a table in our sponsor hall where sponsors can interact with participants (who'll definitely visit for coffee and food). We also have a la carte options for a sponsor who wants visibility without staffing a table.

Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media. Sponsors are encouraged to actively participate and engage with the attendees as peers. All participants including sponsors are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so a discussion will be more appealing than a pitch. Your technical team members may get great insights from the attendee-directed discussions.
