The adoption of CI/CD has automated the process of how DevOps teams build, test, and deliver software at rapid speeds and with high confidence. Although CI/CD platforms offer many benefits, in the attempt to make sophisticated pipelines, many teams run into the issue of “Pipeline Sprawl” - where configurations grow in complexity and volume forcing them to become unmanageable and difficult to scale. Pipeline sprawl also makes it difficult for DevOps teams to identify and reuse common execution patterns which diminishes their ability to efficiently ship new code.

In this talk, presenter will discuss the common pain points associated with existing CI/CD platforms, how they impact teams and organizations, and how to overcome them. The presenter will cover the advantages and disadvantages of supporting multiple CI/CD platforms, and discuss viable options for pipeline configuration management at scale. The talk will pull in examples from his recent experience and from conversations with DevOps teams from across the open source community, startups, and large enterprise companies. Attendees will learn how to manage and scale their pipelines to fit their existing processes, and technical strategies to develop pipeline configurations that diminish potentially costly vendor-lock in.
