Data science is a research-heavy discipline concerned with staying on the cusp of technological advances. Scientists rapidly experiment with cutting-edge techniques and approaches, often coding in highly interactive, but highly unstructured, mediums like Jupyter notebooks.

How can a team integrate this experimental scripting and model handoff into a stable, defendable product?

This talk will be split into two parts:

Converting current data science scripts into production-ready code
- Decoding and mapping Jupyter notebook code
- Persisting and versioning static datasets and data science pipelines
- Defining deployment processes, including model versioning and auto validation
- Asserting stability through automated test cases

Standing up an environment that encourages production-level code from data scientists
- Structuring repos for data science code
- Implementing Git hooks
- Data science code reviews
- Defining acceptance criteria
- Communicating the importance of transparency, stability, and coding standards

Attendees will walk away aware of the importance of processes and structures around the models themselves and with knowledge on how to implement production-ready data science.
