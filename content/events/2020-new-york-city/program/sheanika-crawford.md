What do you do when you’re the newest, last girl standing, and the future of an event series depends on you? At the top of 2019, I was a 6 month old contractor at Verizon with no idea what I was in for. I was content to do commendable work in the background - using my voice to write for our engineer-facing website. I’d get to know our engineers in interviews as they returned from industry conferences. I thought this was as close as I’d get to events, but before I knew it, there was a retiree & Tech Day (Verizon’s adaptation of devopsday) knocking on my door. The rest was history & the adventure ahead was more than had bargained for in the best way. In this talk, I will share how I sought ways to deliver on the culture change that Verizon GTS had been asking for by keeping calm & sprinkling enthusiasm around like glitter. How - over the course of 3 historical events in 1 year, with an awesome planning team, & a few risks, Verizon Tech Day pulled an exceptional NPS score & drew an SRO audience at our last event in 2019 - a 255% increase in attendance (and excitement)! Last, even better for me, right smack in the middle of this journey, I was hired :)
