Jamey is a non-binary adventurer from Buffalo, NY who wishes they were immortal so they’d have time to visit every coffee shop in the world. They’re a senior Rails dev who recently made the plunge into DevRel, and a panelist on the Greater than Code podcast. In their spare time, they do advocacy in the transgender community, write comics and spend as much time as possible in the forest.
