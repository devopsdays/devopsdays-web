Victoria Geronimo originally hails from the nation's
third smallest state, where she grew up playing both
Barbies and Indiana Jones in the woods. She attended
the University of Maryland, College Park for undergrad,
where she studied philosophy and somewhat oddly,
marketing. She moved to New York City in 2012 to
attend Fordham Law, where she got involved with tech
law and policy, which she finessed into a security
consulting position before becoming the head of
information security at a FinTech startup.
Currently, Victoria is a product manager for security &
compliance product at 2nd Watch, where she is
contemplating just what DevSecOps really means and
preaching the difference between security and
compliance. Victoria spends her free time walking
around the city and wondering about its infrastructure.
She also is active in the internet law & policy
community.
