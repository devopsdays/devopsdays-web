When things blow up, what do we do? Drop everything & jump right in to investigate. Sometimes leaving an agitated customer support rep, account manager or some other non-tech person in the dark for a long time. We can and should do better.

I this short talk I will present a couple easy ways to be more transparent during an emergency, and make a case on why the time wasted^W used on comms as opposed to staying on the task at hand could pay off big time.
