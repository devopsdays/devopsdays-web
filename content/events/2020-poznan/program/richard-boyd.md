As more companies become comfortable with the cultural shift towards DevOps, or at least comfortable with the benefits they see others getting from the shift, application engineers are increasingly finding themselves responsible for the infrastructure their applications run on. This responsibility often ends up in the form of a config file that describes their infrastructure and is rarely changed and even more rarely understood. In this talk we'll look at how teams that release application changes several times a day still struggle apply the same principles to their infrastructure code and how we can use modern tooling to apply well-known testing processes to infrastructure changes.
