Building distributed systems is notoriously hard â€¦ building a distributed team, even more so. At Elastic - the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash - everything is distributed; the company and our products. This talk dives into the details of how Elastic is thriving on its distributed model:

* How Elastic started to be distributed by design?
* What our shared values are and what we have learned as we progressed and grew to our current size?
* What the day of an Elastician can look like?
* What we are using in terms of tooling?
* How we hire and onboard new employees?
