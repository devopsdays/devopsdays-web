I’d like to share my story about coming from System Engineering to DevOps. I’d try to explain how this help me and business. How to build high performance DevOps teams and how to sell this whole transition to business. Many companies/people are trying transit to DevOps. Some of them has been successful, some might be still in process, some may even failed. Part of that talk would be recommendation of tooling and sharing best practices around DevOps.
