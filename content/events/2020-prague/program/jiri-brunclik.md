Showmax is Africa's most loved video streaming service. Recently we have added live sports onto the platform and that has completely changed our usage patterns. Suddenly, hordes of people are trying to access the service at the same time to watch their beloved Rugby and Cricket. In this talk we will tell you how we have built our load testing infrastructure to simulate the real users and make sure that our platform can withstand the load.
