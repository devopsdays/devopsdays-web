When you join a new team it can often feel like you’re sinking or swimming for the first few months. How can you learn to contribute while still getting acclimated to the team’s vision, deep domain knowledge, and way of writing code?


In other words, how can you enable all team members - newcomers, experienced engineers, and “superhero” engineers - to contribute in the same way even when their experiences and skillsets are so different?


In the past year, our team at Pivotal added several practices to help everyone contribute with more context and confidence, regardless of experience level. These practices helped our team get closer, share context, and build a collective vision. Our team went from a siloed team with concentrated expertise, to a team with renewed sense of context-sharing and individual empowerment. Our favorite techniques include Learn & Shares, interrupt rotations, and weekly team mobbing exercises. In this talk, we will go over the six practices we put in place, how they work, and how they can transform your team into a team of superheroes.
