You know the struggle of maintaining docker-compose for local dev environment. Running the whole backend stack on your laptop is either impossible or not efficient. We need fast feedbacks and minimize problems with integration.

Garden automates the repetitive parts of your workflow to make developing for Kubernetes and cloud faster and easier. No need to run Docker or Kubernetes on your laptop. Fast, in-cluster builds. Use the same commands and config for dev and CI.
