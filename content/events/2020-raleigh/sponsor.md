<hr>

DevOpsDays Raleigh is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. This year we are holding DevOpsDays at the All Things Open conference. We do not sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. All sponsors will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
