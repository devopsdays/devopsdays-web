Risk management is relatively new to the tech scene but in reality insurance teams, government, and finance have been using risk assessments to make decisions for years. In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how to apply classical risk management concepts to modern DevOps practices. You’ll learn how to build a culture of risk management through a common, shared measurement framework, and how to implement a powerful tool for any organisation: the risk budget.
