Quantum computing is arriving. With quantum computers we can tackle problems in entirely new ways leveraging entanglement, superposition, and interference. Scenario simulations, optimization, AI/ML patterns, and physical processes are areas where quantum computing may show earliest impact.

In this session we'll cover what is quantum computing, why it is so different and important, resources available to developers, and how to get started with access to real quantum systems.
