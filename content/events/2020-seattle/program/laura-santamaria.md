Logging is deceptively simple. You import a library, pass strings to it, and BAM you have logs. However, getting decent, machine-parsable logs is hard because most people don’t understand the value of good logging. Logging is an underutilized tool in the developer’s toolbox, and it is often misunderstood as just another unnecessary debugging tool. In reality, logging is a boon to the people who will be working on a system later down the line, and making fantastic logs really is a team sport. How do you convince the rest of your team to log better?

In this talk, we’ll review these basics of logging to set a baseline:
- the importance of logs
- the different log levels and types
- common misconceptions around logging
- the reason behind the shift from text-based logs to structured, machine-parsable logs

Then, we’ll use those basics to
- understand pain points in proper log adoption,
- answer arguments against extensive logging, and
- review a practical framework for adding the necessary logs to an application that doesn’t have sufficient logs.
