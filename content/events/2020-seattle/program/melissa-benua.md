Software development luminaries have been predicting the demise of 'manual testing' as a discipline for more than a decade. It's true that delivering software today looks very little like it did in 2009, and nothing at all as it did in 1999. Is manual testing one of those practices that has gone by the wayside? Perhaps more importantly, SHOULD it be left to history given all the capabilities we have now around automation and observability and machine learning? Is there room in a continuous integration and delivery system for manual testing? Come find out the answers to this and more in a provocative and thoughtful five minutes!
