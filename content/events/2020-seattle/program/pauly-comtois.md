Managing and leading teams to embrace Agile and DevOps, and make it a way of life that will drive business value, is challenging. Managing and working among remote teams adds a layer of complexity that ensures new and interesting challenges will also become a way of life. I would like to share the trials and successes of building a new remote office, hiring and retaining talent, increasing stakeholder and engineer delight, and removing the miles between our employees.
