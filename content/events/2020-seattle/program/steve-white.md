Title = "Cloud Native Security - A Cultural Shift"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["steve-white"]
+++

In a cloud-native world, the "shift left" mindset for security teams is not just about technology, but also about culture. This talk will meld the two topics, bringing together core cloud-native security concepts such as the "Three Rs" of security with the cultural changes needed to achieve the outcomes the security teams are striving for as their partners in software development and
operations implement XP/agile, SRE and other cloud native concepts. The talk will touch on topics including:
Shift to cloud-native patterns including containers and
functions
Speed of development and the associated shift to XP/agile and DevOps/SRE methods
The impacts these shifts are having on security teams
The need for smart, effective automation, with solutions such as ephemeral systems and immutable infrastructure as core enablers
Automated repaving as a path to effective 100% successful patching
Embedding security in application development and DevOps teams as a full partner, not a "control" function
