Developer Advocate for Open Source

Blaine Carter is the Oracle developer advocate for open source. He applies his exploratory eye and tinkering inclinations to the intersection of open source and Oracle Database. He helps database developers improve their workflow using open source tools and promotes the use of open source inside and outside of Oracle.

Blaine is a firm believer in learning by doing, failing, figuring it out and then sharing.
