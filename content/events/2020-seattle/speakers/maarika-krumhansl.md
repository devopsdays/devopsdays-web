DevOps Technical Manager, Powell's Books

I am a Portland native with 10 years of experience in computer science and technology, ranging from academia to customer support to engineering. I volunteer with PDX Women in Tech to support and empower women and underrepresented folks to pursue careers in tech and to stay in tech. In my free time, I like to practice earthquake emergency preparedness with my Neighborhood Emergency Team (NET), read books, and dance.
