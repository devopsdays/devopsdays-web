Developer Advocate @ HashiCorp

Xander is a Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. Previously, he worked as an SRE at companies including Microsoft, Starbucks, and Target. Xander loves working with infrastructure as code and automating all the things. When not in front of a computer screen, you can find him somewhere with poor lighting, good coffee, and a spooky book.
