#### We're very sorry to announce that DevOpsDays Seattle 2020 will not be happening in April as planned. 

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and growing concern over the spread of the disease, we have decided not to hold DevOpsDays Seattle on April 14th and 15th. While we are disappointed not to host the event in April, the health and well-being of the community is our top priority.

Thank you for your patience as we researched whether we could hold DevOpsDays Seattle later this year. Given the uncertainty of the situation, we have decided not to reschedule. We will be back, better than ever in 2021.

#### Attendees
Starting this evening, March 4th, we will begin canceling ticket registrations and refunding your money for the event. 

#### Speakers
If we reschedule the event for the fall and it works with your schedule we would still love to have you speak. You will not need to resubmit to a CFP. 

#### Sponsors
We are happy to transfer your sponsorship to a future event (either in the fall or 2021) or issue a complete refund. Please let us know your preference. 

If you have any questions please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us at seattle@devopsdays.org
