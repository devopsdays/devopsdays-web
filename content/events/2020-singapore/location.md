## Hotel Fort Canning

Hotel Fort Canning is a luxurious and award-winning conservation hotel tucked within 18 hectares of lush greenery in Fort Canning Park. Considered one of Singapore’s iconic heritage hotels, Hotel Fort Canning bears a storied past that dates back to the early 20th century, with the building itself a former British military administration site. Today, the hotel’s architecture continues to retain much of its colonial glamour, combining it with modern elements of the surrounding parklands - making Hotel Fort Canning one of Singapore's heritage hotels situated within a historical hilltop park.

If all you know of Singapore is that it is a fine city, you're missing out. Singapore has many names: The Lion City. The Garden City. The Asian Tiger. The 'Fine' City. All venerable nicknames.

While its importance as the hub ob Asia is undisputed, it is also home to innovative startups, leading universities, and world-class arts and culture.

Some even say it's the 'easiest place for business,' the 'most liveable city in Asia' and the 'best city in the world to live in for Asia expatriates.'.

So here are some more facts about Singapore:

Singapore has a crime rate so low, ladies stroll without fear in the wee hours of the night. And contrary to Western opinion, there's no strong police presence poised to cane anyone for spitting, chewing gum or scratching cars.

Singapore's stretch of malls accommodate the most fickle shoppers. Shop from Wisma Atrium on one end to Suntec City on the other without feeling the sun.

## English that is so special lah!

Singlish is the unofficial 'first language' of most Singaporeans and one that would bewilder the remaining English-speaking world. It is cobbled together from various influences including Queen's English, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil, dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Bengali, Punjabi and even a smattering of various other European, Indic and Sinitic languages. Can lah!
