### Proposals

There are three ways to propose a topic at DevOpsDays Singapore:

1. __A 30-minute talk__ presented during the conference, usually in the mornings.
1. __An Ignite talk__ presented during the <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format">Ignite sessions</a> (scheduling varies). These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total).
1. __Open Space__: If you'd like to lead a group discussion during the attendee-suggested <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions, it is not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in person at the conference. If you'd like to demo your product or service, you should <a href="../sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and demo it at your table.

### Proposal Review Considerations

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _Broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _New local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _Under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _Original content_: We prefer talks not already presented at another event, especially another one in the local area or one available in recorded form.
- _No third-party submissions_: If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process. This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees.
- _No vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.

### Conference Theme

Our theme this year is the __Cloud Operations__. As DevOps practioners, we need insights into our processes and how effectively our teams are operating (an indicator of how well our DevOps adoption strategy is working). As more teams build and host applications and infrastructure in the cloud, the term _CloudOps_ has gained traction. IT operations professionals have always been responsible for the monitoring, maintenance and installation of servers, networks and other IT infrastructure. With proliferation of API for cloud we have seen more automation services for change management and chargeback, maintaining compliance and configuration.
But, third-party cloud vendors like AWS, GCP and Azure are changing the way Ops teams need to operate their services.

We'd love to hear how you and your organisation tackle these challenges, about failures and successes related to your systems or teams, how you deliver cloud services and/or infrastructure, new tools and methods you have tried or came up with that have produced great or not so great outcomes.

You are also welcome to submit proposals that you feel fall outside this theme.

### Equal Opportunity

DevOpsDays Singapore 2020 is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to invite people of all backgrounds and profiles to submit presentation proposals. All potential speakers will receive consideration without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, ability or age.

We also encourage those who have not presented before and can offer support to anyone who would like to submit a proposal. Please email us {{< email_organizers >}} with any questions.  Even better, just submit your proposal and let us know itâ€™s your first presentation. We can offer support that includes review of your CFP content, speaking and presentation coaching/tips, travel, and accommodation assistance.

### Submit

<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Use [Singapore PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/dodsin20) and provide the details in the form.

### Rules
- Be specific. We aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)
- Detail is good, but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting
- Multiple proposals are welcome. Just respect the other rules
