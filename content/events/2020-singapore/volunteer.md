Thank you for considering to volunteer at DevOpsDays Singapore 2020! If you choose to volunteer at the conference we ask that you commit to three 1.5 to 1 hour shifts. The volunteer duties involve a generous amount of social interaction as our volunteers are asked to help our attendees with the conference experience.

Roles include but are not limited to:

- General Help and Direction
- Attendee Checkin
- Sponsor liaison
- Swag Assistance
- Auditorium Assistance

We will provide you with a volunteer badge and a volunteer tshirt which should be worn during your shift to allow folks to find you for assistance.

Please feel free to attend the conference when you are not on shift.
