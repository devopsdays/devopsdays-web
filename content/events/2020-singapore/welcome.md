      <p>Our theme this year is the Cloud Operations. As more teams build and host applications and infrastructure in the cloud, the term <strong>CloudOps</strong> has gained traction. IT operations professionals have always been responsible for the monitoring, maintenance and installation of servers, networks and other IT infrastructure. With proliferation of API for cloud we have seen more automation services for change management and chargeback, maintaining compliance and configuration.</p>
