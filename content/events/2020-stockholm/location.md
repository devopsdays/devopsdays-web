### Virtual event

Devopsdays Stockholm 2020 will be held as a virtual event.

##### Break out discussions

The nexus of the event will be in
<a href="https://discord.gg/hGa44CZ">Discord</a>. The server is already
open so you can check in to see that it's working. Clients for Discord
exist both for laptops and mobile phones but you can also join directly
from a web browser - although video won't work without a native app.

After each talk we'll have break out rooms for discusisons and the
afternoon Open Space discussions will also be held in these. There will
be five rooms named after norse gods and godesses. There's also
the-lobby and the-main-hall to just hang out in and talk to whoever else
is there. For those of us who feel audio is over rated we provide a
couple of text based chat channels as well.

##### Presentations

Our three main talks and the five ignites will be held as a Zoom webinar
and should also be available on Youtube after the event. We'll post the
links here and in the Discord
<a href="https://discord.gg/ES5h8jv">#announcements</a> channel as soon as
we have them.

##### Open space topics and Voting

The topics for the Open Space discussions will be presented in Miro -
and we'll also do the dot-voting there. A link to the Miro board will be
available from the Discord
<a href="https://discord.gg/ES5h8jv">#announcements</a> channel as will
the assignment of topics to break out rooms.

### Public transport

Feel free to take a bus or subway tour but as this is a virtual event
we can't really suggest where you should go.

### Walking

Taking a walk outside is generally good for your health but whether
you do so during the event is totally up to you.

### Map
This is a virtual event but this map shows the location of the building in our logo.
