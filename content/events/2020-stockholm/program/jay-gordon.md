**Ignite Talk**

Do you know Brent?  Brent is a hero.  He spends his time-fighting fires on his own rather than working on the big picture issues. When Brent puts out the latest fire, he's given endless praise by leaders.  Brent doesn't seem to know how to put out the fire permanently but he remains the hero.
