Fireside chat with John Willis. John is known as one of the founding fathers of DevOps. In this Fireside chat we want to talk with him about DevOps Transformations: what they need to work and why still some fail.
A fireside chat is an informal, yet structured interview between a moderator and a guest. It's a great opportunity to hear personal experiences from the guest, gain a deeper understanding and to jointly develop new ideas. As we want this conversion to be interactive we invite our participants to activly join the discussion between the moderator and the guest by asking questions via the chat function.
