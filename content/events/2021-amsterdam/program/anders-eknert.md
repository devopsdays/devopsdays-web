Organizations have relied on wikis and tribal knowledge to document and enforce important rules that govern how their systems behave, but today, many organizations pursue "policy as code" for greater control and visibility over their stacks. Instead of writing policies in documents or relying on manual checks, organizations leverage policy engines to codify and enforce rules across all of their systems.

Join for an introduction to "policy as code" that demonstrates (with real-world examples) how you can codify and enforce your organizations complex policies. The session will show how you can leverage the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's Open Policy Agent project to enforce a range of policies over Kubernetes, Terraform, microservices, and more.
