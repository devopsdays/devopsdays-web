The requirements of digital operations for businesses in any industry can stretch resources and cause stress. Keeping on top of your organization’s technical platforms is daunting. It’s easy to miss things when something goes wrong and your team is embroiled in an incident and customer service teams are often left out of feedback loops. As the team closest to the customer, incorporating customer service teams into the DevOps lifecycle will reduce silos, shorten feedback loops, empower agents and delight your customers. 

One thing you can never go short on is communications with your users during an incident. Customer service teams are increasingly important in the incident identification and response process. Full-Case Ownership is the methodology that brings customer service teams inline with organizational goals and ultimately the customer experience. 
 
In this talk, you will learn the importance of full-case ownership and customer service ops, and how to help customer service practitioners and managers establish strong practices with their peers in engineering organizations in service of your customers.
