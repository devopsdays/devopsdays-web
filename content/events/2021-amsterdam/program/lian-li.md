MoneyBank Inc is a fintech enterprise that recently made the jump to K8s and GitOps to cope with the shift of demands from cranking out features towards stability and scalability. Yet, even with a fully automated CICD and shiny new microservices, features still take weeks to be released. As teams keep waiting on each other, frustrations, resentment and mistrust grow.

MoneyBankâ€™s situation is typical for organisations with enterprise processes and startup mindsets. When faced with problems, the urge is often to move fast and automate them away. However, the cultural and regulatory structures to support these changes are not in the scope of said automation. One more piece is missing to address the needs of non-technical stakeholders within the ever changing CICD landscape.

In this talk, we will attempt to automate the non-automatable with ReleaseOps: GitOps for the people.
