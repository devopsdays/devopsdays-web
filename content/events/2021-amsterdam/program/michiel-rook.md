This talk tells the story of a recent real life project I did together with 4 development teams. Learn how we adopted the textbook practices, patterns and principles of Continuous Delivery and applied them to an existing monolithic application. I’ll discuss what worked well & what didn’t, and how we dealt with the messy reality of failing pipelines, flaky tests and brittle infrastructure. Find out how we transitioned from mostly manual, bi-weekly, error-prone releases to 30 automated deployments per day, while significantly reducing overhead and increasing quality.
