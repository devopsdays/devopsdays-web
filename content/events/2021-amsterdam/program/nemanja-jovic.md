Participants in this session would be presented with particular challenge. Challenge concerns monitoring of entities that will be stored in Azure Key Vault service â€“ certificates, keys & secrets. Participants will get out of the session with fresh ideas on how to build a solution that was discussed between each other. As a spice on top of all ideas, I will point to framework that was built in-house at the Schuberg Philis.
