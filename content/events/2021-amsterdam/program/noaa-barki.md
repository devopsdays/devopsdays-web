A smart person learns from their own mistakes, but a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others. 
 

When launching our product, we wanted to learn as much as possible about typical pains in our ecosystem, and did so by reviewing many post-mortems (100+!) to discover the recurring patterns, anti-patterns, and root causes of typical outages in Kubernetes-based systems.  
 

In this talk we have aggregated for you the insights we gathered, and in particular will review the most obvious DON'Ts and some less obvious ones, that may help you prevent your next production outage by learning from others' real world (horror) stories.
