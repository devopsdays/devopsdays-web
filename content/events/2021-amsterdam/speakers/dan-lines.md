Dan is a software engineer at heart. Two years ago he started a company with another engineer, Ori Keren. Dan is currently responsible for customer success, marketing and sales. Before LinearB Dan was a dev team lead, and VP of Engineering. Heâ€™s obsessed with how dev teams work together. Like what makes a great company culture? How can engineering leaders be data-driven without being performance tyrants? Why can cars drive themselves but I have to spend 30 minutes every day manually updating my project tickets? Dan looks forward to exploring these problems and finding solutions that make developers' lives easier.
