Els van Vessem (they/them) works as a BI specialist at a hospital in Rotterdam, after 7 years in the IT and BI contracting/consulting business. Their official task: bring order to the chaos of all the different sources of data, and create dashboards on how many COVID-19 patients the hospital has on each ward. Their secret mission: nudging their new coworkers in a devops direction. Outside of work they hang out on twitter (@geekingthething), read a whole lot of books, and spoil their two kitties with toys and treats.
