Jody has been a DevOps advocate for 4+ years, a Windows and Linux admin, and a theatre major-turned-technologist with a passion for languages of all kinds. She’s worked with small startups and gaming giants alike, and she now focuses on helping individuals and organizations understand and solve their infrastructure woes by connecting the dots between infrastructure, security, and application development and deployment. When not working with technologists to improve all the things, Jody spends her time learning new languages, working with dogs, and speaking publicly about mental health and inclusive cultural practices.
