Lian always wanted to save the world. After a failed attempt at becoming a lawyer, she decided to do something with computers instead. Working as a Fullstack Software Engineer, she got into attending tech events and giving talks on Machine Learning with JavaScript all around the world. She fell in love with the tech community, which led to her co-organising the community conference ServerlessDays Amsterdam. Currently, Lian lives in Amsterdam and works as Engineering Manager at Container Solutions, a consultancy focused on programmable infrastructure.
