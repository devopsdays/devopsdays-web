DataOps Enthusiast & Data / DevOps Engineer @ Fullstaq.
DataOps and Data Engineering enthusiast. I get enthusiastic about data and data technologies and mostly about moving all that data around and have people smarter than me do smart things with it. Made the switch unknowingly into a Data engineering role some 2 years ago and haven't looked back since Also love making tacos, anything food-related basically, and started playing the guitar again.
