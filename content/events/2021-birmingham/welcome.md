    <h1>
	<p>We have had to cancel our first in-person event in March 2021 due to COVID</p>
    </h1>
	<p> Refunds have been issued to ticket holders and we will be aiming for a 2022 relaunch provided the situation allows it!</p>
	<p>DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from community, for the benefit of the community.
      We are not a commercial conference and we believe that our focus on serving the community creates a truly unique experience for both delegates and sponsors.
