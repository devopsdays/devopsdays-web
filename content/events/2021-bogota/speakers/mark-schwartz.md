I'm an award-winning CIO, a change agent who has led organizations in creating innovative solutions to some of the toughest business challenges around. I'm known for formulating and articulating powerful visions and using them to drive change in complex, matrixed, and sometimes rigid and bureaucratic environments. The author of a book on "The Art of Business Value," I know how to use technology to create competitive advantage, increase revenue, accomplish mission, and generate value. I've published three other books on IT leadership and IT-business alignment: "A Seat at the Table: IT Leadership in the Age of Agility," "War and Peace and IT: Business Leadership, Technology, and Success in the Digital Age," and "The (Delicate) Art of Bureaucracy: Digital Transformation with the Monkey, the Razor, and the Sumo Wrestler." I also have experience as a CEO, with MBA degree from Wharton and Computer Science degree from Yale.

As an Enterprise Strategist at Amazon Web Services, I work with senior executives from the world's largest companies to help them formulate strategies and overcome impediments to succeeding in the digital era. I speak frequently at conferences on topics such as innovation, digital transformation, security, cultural change, governance and investment management, organizational agility, resilience, DevOps, and change leadership. I also represent AWS to the press, industry analysts, and international organizations like WEF. I'm editor-in-chief of the AWS Enterprise Strategy blog and write numerous articles, e-books, and blog posts.

In 2010 I was named by Computerworld Magazine one of the Premier 100 IT Leaders, an award for "exceptional technology leadership, innovative ideas for solving business challenges, and effectively managed IT strategies.” I've also been recognized by Information Week, CIO Magazine, and Federal Computer News, and in 2015 was named the federal government’s Leader in Technology Innovation by AFFIRM.
