Prior to Shoreline, I spent 7.5 years at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I ran their analytic and relational database services. Within analytics, this included Athena, Data Pipeline, EMR, Glue, LakeFormation, Managed Blockchain, and Redshift. Within relational databases, these were Aurora for MySQL and PostgreSQL and RDS for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Managing services deployed on millions of nodes while ticketing on a per-instance basis taught me the importance of distributed control and automation.
