**Senior Developer Advocate at Snyk**

Eric has over 25 years of professional experience in enterprise software development and architecture and has been practicing DevOps concepts since long before the term was coined. A continuous integration advocate and implementer for nearly a decade, a former Jenkins Ambassador, and a Docker user since the early days back in 2013.

A child of the ’80s and a second-generation software developer–his father was a SNOBOL coder in the 60s–Eric has been coding since his elementary school days bash on 8-bit machines. In his spare time, he enjoys spending time with his wife and kids, traveling, photography, and, of course, hacking on software.

Nowadays, Eric is a Senior Developer Advocate at [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io/) where he helps developers secure the applications, containers, and Kubernetes platforms they build and deploy to.

Eric is “@ericsmalling” on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericsmalling), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericsmalling/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ericsmalling).
