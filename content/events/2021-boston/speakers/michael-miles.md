I am passionate about development and working with the latest open source technologies. I have been working in web engineering since 2003, utilizing various languages and frameworks. As the Director of Web Development at MIT Sloan, I lead the development, maintenance and growth of the digital properties for the school, as well as, the development team that supports them. I am also the host of the podcast Developing Up, which is focused on career growth and the non-technical side of being a developer.
