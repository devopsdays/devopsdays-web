## <a name="virtual">Virtual:

For the virtual part of this conference, we will communicate using the DevOpsDays Buffalo Discord server and will be streaming the talks via YouTube. The link to the server will be provided to attendees via their registration email a few days prior to the event.

Whether you purchased a ticket to the physical or the virtual-only event, the first half of the day - on both days - will begin with a virtual portion. 
## <a name="transit-drive-in"></a>Transit Drive-In:

The Transit Drive-In in Lockport, NY has been lovingly cared for by three generations of the Cohen family over a period of 64-years. Rick Cohen, the current owner, is continuously improving the technology and capability of the facility while maintaining the nostalgic 60's era charm. Rick is a big community advocate working to raise awareness and funding to save and restore failing drive-ins across the United States. Rick is also a big supporter of the local Buffalo Community and is known to open the theater for Buffalo Bills night games with free admission.

A short drive down the 990 from Buffalo, the Transit Drive-in is a true gem of a bygone era in cinematic history. We hope that our choice of this venue helps raise awareness of the unique possibilities that a drive-in can offer, and we hope it encourages sponsors and attendees alike to consider a drive-in the next time they plan a night at the theater.

If you purchased a ticket to the physical event, the first half of the day will still begin with a virtual portion. During the second part of the day, there will be an intermission to give attendees time to drive to the physical venue at Transit Drive-In.

The Transit Drive-in is located in a rural community a few miles North and East of Buffalo. There is minimal travel pressure across the region during early October, so blocks of rooms at a specific hotel have not been prepared in advance. For locations near the venue, we would suggest:

### Hampton Inn Lockport - Buffalo
6082 S Transit Rd  
Lockport, NY 14094  

### Holiday Inn Express
