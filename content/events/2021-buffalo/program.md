This conference will take place in two parts on both days:
- If you purchased a virtual-only ticket, you will be able to attend all parts of the conference [virtually](/events/2021-buffalo/location/#virtual) via Discord. The link to the server will be provided to attendees via their registration email a few days prior to the event.
- If you purchased a physical ticket, you will still attend the first part of each day [virtually](/events/2021-buffalo/location/#virtual); however, there will be an intermission mid-day to allow attendees to drive to the physical, evening portion of the event at [Transit Drive-In](/events/2021-buffalo/location/#transit-drive-in).
