Dewan Ahmed is a developer advocate based in Moncton, NB, Canada. Before Red Hat, he wore many hats at IBM as a developer, QA, PM, consultant & developer advocate. Dewanâ€™s primary focus is DevOps & GitOps but he considers himself a generalist. He regularly publishes on LinkedIn, openshift.com and on his personal blog (https://www.dewanahmed.com/).

Besides work, Dewan helps students & newgrads as a career coach by doing free resume reviews and 1x1 career sessions. If you ever take a road trip to the Eastern part of Canada and crave some Atlantic seafood, give Dewan a call.
