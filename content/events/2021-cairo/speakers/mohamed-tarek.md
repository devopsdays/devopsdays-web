Mohamed Tarek is a  Software Testing Expert at DXC Technology.  He started his testing journey in March 2010. 

In 2012, he shifted his focus to Performance Testing and since then he is working as a dedicated performance tester.

There was not so much guidance back then on how to operate ideally as a performance tester that is why there were some failures in the way but the more you work the more you learn and adapt.  

Three years ago, he decided to start his own blog "TheTestTherapist.com" and he does his best to post topics in a bi-weekly basis.
