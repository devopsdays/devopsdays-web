Have you started your Cloud-Native journey? The first thing you need to do is containerize your applications. Now that you’ve gotten past that first hurdle, I’m here to say there’s more to think about. In this talk, I’ll talk about stumbling blocks that a masked enterprise called AsgharLabs had to deal with, and hopefully shed some light on things you haven’t thought about.
