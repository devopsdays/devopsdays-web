The low-power semi-connected edge provides a host of orchestration and maintenance challenges. K3s and Rancher's Fleet can overcome those with edge-triggered updating, customized bundles, and can scale to hundreds of thousands of remote clusters. 

In this workshop, we will: 

Install 2 k3s clusters on our local machine. 

Install Rancher (and Fleet) and rancher on one of them. 

Add the second cluster in Fleet. 

Deploy a sample workload to the cluster.
