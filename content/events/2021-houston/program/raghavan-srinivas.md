The IT world has evolved from the stateless 12-factor simple “Hello World!” app on Kubernetes to refactor more complex data-driven apps and incorporate newer paradigms such as microservices, service mesh, etc. Dev, DevOps and Ops of these distributed teams and systems are still an ongoing major challenge.

How are teams evolving to deal with the challenges and what steps are needed to mitigate some of the issues? In this session we will start with identifying these challenges and how to solve them with a comprehensive practical example based around open sourced k8ssandra.io which relies on the cass-operator and is evolving to provide multi data center support.

After attending this session, attendees (Devs, Devops and Ops audience alike) will get a holistic perspective of the challenges of cloud-native approach – gain a better understanding of data durability, routine backups and restore, observability, HA and DR. Dissecting the example with a step-by-step approach, they will walk away with practical tips for a robust architecture.
