Title = "Playing Zone Offense: SRE Within Moore’s Zones Model"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["sarah-butt"]
+++

Moore’s Zones Model is widely used to help companies harness the power of innovation, remain competitive in rapidly changing markets, and prove sustained value by catching the right innovation waves. This talk uses Moore’s four zones as a foundation to examining how SRE strategy and priorities can align with company goals and different stages of a product’s lifecycle to provide unique strategic benefit. From examining why incident severity definitions and reliability success metrics should be different between non-prod and prod, to discussing why large production systems often seem to have an “all they can eat” attitude when it comes to occupying an SRE organization’s time, to predicting the potential teething pains as an SRE organization prepares to support a new product’s launch, this talk relies on Moore’s Zones Model to help attendees understand not only how differing needs at different stages of a product lifecycle occur, but what practical ways they can help turn these moments into an opportunity for SRE to provide the broader company with unique value. Attendees should walk away feeling empowered to action that helps them align their SRE organization with the broader company’s direction and strategic growth plans. The material and frameworks covered in this talk help cultivate a mindset that extends beyond the boundaries of an SRE or technology organization and encompasses business process, strategy, and trends. From providing concrete examples across industries of why system reliability is important to a business’s success to exploring how SRE can provide value as a strategic partner in an organization (instead of viewed only as the people putting out fires to keep the lights on!), this talk seeks to provide unique insight into the intersection of SRE and business strategy. Through practical examples, applicable frameworks, and explanations of relevant business concepts, this talk aims to help break down silos and facilitate shared growth and value between “the technology org” and “the rest of the business.”
