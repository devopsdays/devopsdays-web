Dr. Mark Peters works for Novetta as Technical Lead on several DoD cyber programs in San Antonio, TX.  A self-expressed DevOps junkie, his value-stream focuses on integrating teams and automating them away from value-wasting repetition. A cybersecurity expert, he had a full USAF career and now holds multiple industry certifications including a CISSP.  He authored "Cashing in on Cyberpower" analyzing a decade of cyber-attacks from an economic perspective. In his spare time, he reads, thinks, writes, and then (usually) speaks and holds a Judo black belt.  As a DevOps Institute ambassador, and US Chapter Chair, he enjoys working with individuals across the globe on unique solutions to integrate cybersecurity.
