Sarah is a former audio engineer turned technology professional who has spent the past 6 years of her career at Salesforce and Dell. In 2016, she read The Phoenix Project, and she's been talking (almost) nonstop about DevOps, SRE, and Service Ownership since. Sarah is a 2021 MBA graduate from The University of Texas (Hook'em!) where she did graduate work studying the intersection of technology, business, and people in the context of DevOps and SRE. A few of her favorite topics include user-centric monitoring, intelligent alerting, and using innovative technology to drive fault tolerance and high availability of complex distributed systems. She is currently part of Salesforce's SRE organization, where you'll often find her talking about topics such as resiliency, monitoring, and incident management and response. In her free time, she enjoys hiking in the Texas Hill Country with Rosie, her yellow lab.
