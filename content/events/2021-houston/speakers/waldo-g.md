Waldo is a Tech Evangelist for Datadog, which means that he gets to travel and meet people, and advocate on their behalf.  He is a recovering SRE and Operations Engineer, has been active in the DevOps community for quite some time, and is keen on helping organizations stop hurting themselves.  Despite being a raging introvert, he enjoys public speaking.  In his spare time, he enjoys collecting hobbies that he doesn't have the time to engage in.  He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.
