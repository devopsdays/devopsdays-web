##### We greatly value sponsors for this open event. Please see our <a href="https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2021/houston/devopsdays-houston-2021-prospectus.pdf">Sponsorship Prospectus</a> for details about the event and sponsorship levels. If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<hr>

devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
Platinum and Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.

<a name="FAQ"><h2>Sponsor FAQ</h2><a/>
<dl>
    <dt>What exactly will the sponsors have available to them in the sponsors’ room?</dt>
    <dd>We will provide a table 6’x30” with a black tablecloth and a couple of chairs. You are welcome to bring your own tablecloth, posters, table signs, rollup banners, etc. to decorate your space. If you plan to hang a banner on the wall, make sure you bring 3mm command strips as that is the only approved way to attach things to the wall. Please also note that your table may not be next to the wall. 
	<br/>
	<strike>Silver sponsors please remember that you will be sharing a table with another sponsor.</strike> To promote social distancing, each Silver sponsor will be provided with their own table.</dd>
    <dt>What dates/times can we set up and tear down?</dt>
    <dd>Sponsors can access the room on September 20, 6pm-8pm or on September 21, starting at 6am.</dd>
    <dt>How do we ship to the venue?</dt>
    <dd>Please coordinate all shipping needs with Norris Conference Center. You will get contact information via email in late August. Norris is asking to NOT ship anything far in advance, as they do not have sufficient storage facilities.</dd>
    <dt>What should we expect regarding electricity? (how much, any fees, etc)</dt>
    <dd>There are no fees. There are a number of power outlets along the walls of the room. However, we suggest that you bring a few extension cords, as there may not be enough power outlets or they may not be close enough to your table to be reachable by a laptop/monitor cable.</dd>
    <dt>What should we expect regarding WiFi? (how much, any fees, etc)</dt>
    <dd>There will be free WiFi, but wired connections will not be provided.</dd>
    <dt>Whom should we send?</dt>
    <dd>This is a community event, so it is better to send engineers rather than sales people.</dd>
    <dt>As a Platinum we are supposed to have 5-minute slot to address the attendees. When will that be? How will it work?</dt>
    <dd>We are still working on an exact schedule. An email in late August will provide additional details.</dd>
    <dt>How do we get our free tickets to the event?</dt>
    <dd>An access code will be emailed to you in early July. Please have your attendees register by September 1. </dd>
	<dt>Does our team need to register upon arrival?</dt>
	<dd>All attendees (including sponsors) must check-in at registration on the morning of the first day of the conference. </dd>
    <dt>How much dedicated time will sponsors have with the attendees?</dt>
    <dd>We are working on a program schedule, please keep checking the {{< event_link page="program" text="program" >}} for updates.</dd>
    <dt>Can we bring small giveaways, stickers, mugs, pens, etc.?</dt>
    <dd>Of course.</dd>
    <dt>Can we raffle off stuff (Lego sets, gift cards, iPads, etc.)?</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>
	<dt>As a sponsor, can we receive a copy of the attendee list?</dt>
	<dd>Per DevOpsDays Policy, we do not provide a list of attendees. Sponsors are encouraged to engage with attendees at the event. The organizers have planned activities and raffles that will only be eligible to attendees that have visited all sponsor booths. Sponsors are welcome to collect contact information of attendees who elect to provide this information.</dd>
	<dt>Will there be any virtual components to the event?</dt>
	<dd>No. DevOpsDays Houston 2021 will be an in person event. Organizing committee is not planning for any virtual components</dd>
