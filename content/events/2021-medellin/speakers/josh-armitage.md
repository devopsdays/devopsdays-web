Known for a booming voice and distinct lack of a sense of humour, Josh works as a consultant after spending time with everything from mainframes to machine learning and kubernetes. Having split his life half in the UK, half in Australia, he's now back in London helping regulated enterprises embrace lean software development, cloud native architectures and team happiness as a true north metric.
