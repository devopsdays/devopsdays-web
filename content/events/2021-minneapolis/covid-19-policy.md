In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, devopsdays Minneapolis is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2021 event:

  * We plan to have a hybrid event with in-person and online components.

  * Masks (covering nose and mouth) and social distancing will be expected for in-person participants at the devopsdays MSP 2021 event.
    * We are following the [Minnesota Department of Health Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/facecover.html) and the [City of Minneapolis: COVID-19 Health & Safety Information](https://www.minneapolis.org/covid-19-health-safety/).
    *  While the city-wide and state-wide mask mandates have been lifted, *we will continue to require masks for our event*. We prioritize the needs of vulnerable members of our community, including parents whose children are not yet able to be vaccinated, and we want to keep everyone's families safe as we gather.


  * We are asking all in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) to have received a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two (2) weeks prior to this event, by July 5, 2021.

  * If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by July 6, 2021 and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
