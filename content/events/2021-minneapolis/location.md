We offer wheelchair-designated spaces, chairs, and standing options (with tall tables) in the mainstage session room; a quiet room; bathrooms labeled according to the facilities they contain; professional live captioning of mainstage sessions; ingredient labeling (based on data provided when registering); and private space (upon request) for those nursing. We'd also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs upon request: {{< email_organizers >}}

The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/airport">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. From there, you can walk (under a mile) or transfer to a free bus on Nicollet Mall in downtown. Rideshare services are also available.
