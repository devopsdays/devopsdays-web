Title = "The metrics question: evolving past MTTX"

We often talk about how we canâ€™t measure learning from incidents with the traditional metrics (MTTR, MTTD, Number of incidents) yet leadership continues to request them. During this talk I will share how I have managed to evolve our metrics program where we can share metrics while adding context in order to make the most out of our incident learnings and help improve the sociotechnical systems that we work with every day.
