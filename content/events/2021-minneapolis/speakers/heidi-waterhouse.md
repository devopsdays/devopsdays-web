Heidi Waterhouse is a Transformation Advocate for LaunchDarkly. She specializes in asking questions about things you think you already understand, and looking sympathetic about the real constraints you have. When she is not building a very tiny media empire in her basement, she sews her own clothes to have pockets for her microphone packs.
