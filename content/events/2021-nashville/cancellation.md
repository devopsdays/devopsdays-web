<p>
Due to the ongoing pandemic, the recent rise in case numbers, and the more infectious Delta variant, the organizers of DevOpsDays Nashville have decided to postpone our in-person October 2021 conference.
</p>
<p>
Our new date for DevOpsDays Nashville at Music City Center will be <i>May 5-6, 2022</i>.
</p>
<p>
We did not make this decision lightly.  The organizers of DevOpsDays Nashville started planning this conference in May 2019, and we so badly wanted to put on this conference in October 2021 after a couple delays.  We are very excited about 2022 and canâ€™t wait to put on an in-person event!
</p>
<h3>Sponsors</h3>
<p>
Your sponsorship will automatically rollover to our 2022 conference.  No action is required by your organization.  As always, we appreciate your support to the local Nashville community, the practice and advocation of DevOps, and to specifically the DevOpsDays Nashville conference.  
</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>
We are going to temporarily close our CFP process, and will share our newly-adjusted timelines to you soon.  If you know you cannot make the May 5-6, 2022 dates, you can withdraw your submission.
