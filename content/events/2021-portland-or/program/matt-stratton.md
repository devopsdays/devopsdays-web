Title = "Kubernetes, You Rainbow-Infused Space Unicorn: What Leslie Knope Can Teach Us About DevOps"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["matt-stratton"]
+++

Leslie Knope inspired us all on the television show, "Parks and Recreation" to be better people and to care about our communities. Under the surface, Leslie was actually providing great insight into what DevOps is all about?

Leslie's wisdom isn't limited to the wonder of waffles and building better parks. In this Ignite, I will offer up some lessons that apply to the practice of building and operating software, as well as effecting change in your company. DevOps is about friends, waffles, and work. Or waffles, friends, and work. But work always comes third.
