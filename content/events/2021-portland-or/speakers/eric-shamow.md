Eric Shamow is an SRE Manager in the Compute organization at Twitter. He's spent about 20 years at the boundary of infrastructure and business - immediately prior to Twitter he was the Manager for the Platform and Reliability teams at BlueOwl, State Farm’s insuretech startup. Eric spent several years as the Methodologies Lead for Puppet in the early 00’s, visiting lots of development environments to try and understand what made collaborative infrastructure approaches stick (or not stick, as was too often the case).
