Jace currently works as a Senior Software Engineer at Savi Solutions. He first fell in love with software development at the age of 14 when he taught himself how to write his first application. He received his first series of "real" programming jobs by building a Job Procurement Bot that would autonomously scrape the web and apply for hundreds of job opportunities per week. When he is not working, he enjoys hanging out with his family or being towed around the neighborhood on his longboard by his dog.
