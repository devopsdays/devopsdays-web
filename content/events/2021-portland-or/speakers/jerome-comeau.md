Jerome (he/him) has worked in the IT industry for 25 years, mostly in Operations; in the last 5 years he's worked in Management, which means he probably shouldn't be talking about unions, but he can't help himself. Jerome lives in Portland, OR with his partner, three dogs, and a cat. Photos of dogs and cat available upon request.
