Rachel is an infrastructure engineer in Portland working on provisioning the internet (kidding, sorta). While DevOps Days is a highlight of the year, she also works on SeaGL (Seattle GNU/Linux) on the Program committee and used to chair PyDX, a Portland Python conference from 2015-2016. Rachel is a believer in open source and the power of games to tell stories (and also blow up monsters).
