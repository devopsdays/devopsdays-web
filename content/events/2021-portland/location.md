We're going to be doing an online event this year, not in person. We'd love to
see all of you in one place once it's safe but, dang, who knows. Details are
still a little TBD, but you can expect some great talks and interactive
sessions! This won't just be a Youtube playlist we point you at.

    Example from Minneapolis 2020

    We offer wheelchair-designated spaces, chairs, and standing options (with tall tables) in the mainstage session room; a quiet room; bathrooms labeled according to the facilities they contain; professional live captioning of mainstage sessions; ingredient labeling (based on data provided when registering); and private space (upon request) for those nursing. We'd also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs upon request: {{< email_organizers >}}
