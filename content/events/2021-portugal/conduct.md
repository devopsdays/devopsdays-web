All participants (including speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, staff and volunteers) at devopsdays Portugal are required to abide by the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help us achieve a safe and positive event experience for everyone.

### The Quick Version

Our conference is committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, religion or lack thereof, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

### The Less Quick Version

Unacceptable behaviour includes (but is not limited to):

* offensive verbal comments related to; 
* gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, professional ability, physical appearance, body size, education, financial background, technology choices,
* sexual images in public spaces,
* deliberate intimidation, bullying, harassment,
* stalking, following,
* harassing photography or recording,
* sustained disruption of talks or other events,
* inappropriate physical contact,
* unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If any participant or group of participants engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, the event organisers will take the appropriate action, including warning or expulsion from the conference with no refund or contacting the appropriate authorities.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their t-shirts. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to adhere to the code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
 
### Inclusive Language

In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment, we strongly believe it is important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.

##### Ableism

Words like "crazy", "dumb", "insane" or "lame" are examples of ableist language, devaluing and insulting people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more suitable, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please [read this guide](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html).

##### Sexism

Using gendered terms like "dude" or "guys" to address a group of people of varying genders contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.
