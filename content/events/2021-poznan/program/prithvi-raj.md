Chaos engineering has come a long way from its early days at Netflix. Its importance is no longer questioned in the community but as it has gone mainstream, teams quickly learn that adoption is not a given. As the huge mass of legacy applications move to the Kubernetes-Native approach, an important problem arises, testing the right application the right way. In this talk, we introduce Chaos Engineering and further talk about the evolution of the ecosystem while adopting chaos engineering as a practice. We take an example of the LitmusChaos CNCF project to demonstrate the chaos engineering journey. Further, we would discuss how given the application of your choice could be extended and tested using standard Kubernetes CRs with LitmusChaos to ensure the best possible resiliency.
