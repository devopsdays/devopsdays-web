10 years ago we had the idea to organise a conference in Gent to bridge the gap between developers and the people runing their code. It was the start of a new global movement. We never predicted that #devops would be where #devops is today. The word devops has evolved, the community has evolved. Over the years the word devops lost it’s meaning at least it’s original meaning. The real challenge for the next decade will be to see how we can revive those original values and ideas, if at all… Can we fix Devops? This talk will give you some Ideas about that.
