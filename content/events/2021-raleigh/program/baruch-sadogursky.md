Title = "Best Practices In Implementing Container Image Promotion Pipelines"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["baruch-sadogursky"]

Surprisingly, implementing a secure, robust and fast promotion pipelines for container images is not as easy as it might sound. Automating dependency resolution (base images), implementing multiple registries for different maturity stages and making sure that we actually run in production containers from the images we intended can be tricky. In this talk, we will compare different approaches, compile a wish-list of features and create a pipeline that checks all the boxes using free and open-source tools.
