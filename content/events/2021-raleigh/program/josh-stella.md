The cloud has changed the way hackers operate, and you need to change how you think about securing your cloud assets against this new generation of exploits.

In this talk, Josh Stella, CTO of Fugue, will walk through a simulation of an advanced cloud misconfiguration exploit. He’ll explain at every step how common—but frequently overlooked—mistakes leave cloud data vulnerable, and how most cloud-based data breaches go undetected, even long after the fact. 

You’ll gain fresh insights into how to think critically about your cloud security posture and how to identify and eliminate serious misconfiguration risks. 
 
In this session, you’ll learn:

How cloud misconfigurations occur and why they go frequently go undetected
How to assess your cloud environment for misconfiguration vulnerabilities
How to prevent misconfigurations using policy-as-code
