Our app ecosystems expanding complexity means we require more advanced tools to observe them properly. The right tooling will help you to track down the causes of problems, or even prevent them proactively.  Different components pose different observability needs. Then you need to correlate different data types to make sense of things. I'll discuss a framework for considering the info you need. Then I'll show ways of abstracting info to make it more easily digestible. Finally, armed with this information, you'll be able to share information so teams can make decisions based on the same information.
