I graduated from NC State University in May of 2020 and Co-Founded Collab LLC while still in college with two colleagues from the electrical and computer engineering program. Collab LLC is a custom software consulting firm focused on creating long term relationships with our partners. I have taken over the role of COO and continue to learn and implement all that I can to help maximize our business/tech flows.
