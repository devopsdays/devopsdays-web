Waldo is a geek, and if you find him odd, there are plenty of things you could blame that on.  He's a long-time SysOps Engineer, enjoys leading teams, and is active in the DevOps community.  He may or may not be Batman.  He is pretty keenon helping orgs stop hurting themselves, insight tooling (trending  monitoring alerting), and automation in general, and actually enjoys public speaking.  Hetakes joy in helping teams and orgs to stop hurting themselves.  In his spare time, he enjoys collecting hobbies that he doesn't have the time to engage in.  He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.
