I've been working for 5 years in mission critical companies, planning, designing and executing the deployment of IT infrastructure in public and private cloud, supporting their services, including VMs, operating systems, and applications.

I believe in technology as a tool to solve problems and I like working for companies that are focused on the customer and have the purpose of positively transforming society.

Some projects I'm proud of:
⚡ Planned and executed digital transformation projects, creating distributed, scalable environments focusing on meeting the company's budget planning efforts.
⚡ I actively participated in the PCI-DSS Certification process of a payment method company.
⚡ I manage the SysAdminas Community with the goal of bringing more women to the infrastructure area and for this work we received Elastic recognitions at the Elastic Search Awards in 2019 and reached the end of the Cisco IT Blog Awards in 2020.
⚡ In partnership with another professional colleague, I wrote a guide on IT infrastructure in order to help beginners to study through accessible content and in Portuguese.
⚡ Elastic Gold Contributor in the Elastic Contributor Program in 2020 and 2021.
⚡ VMware vExpert in the vExpert program in 2021.
