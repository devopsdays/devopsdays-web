I’ve spent the last decade embedded in technology: building and launching large-scale products and systems for people. I’ve worked as an individual contributor solving problems, or as the one supporting the teams who directly do it. I’m not bothered about titles or roles. I wear many hats — as many as needed to ship great stuff.
