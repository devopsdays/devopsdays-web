I have worked in software for over 17 years. I started my career at Microsoft where I worked on a number of things - rich text layout, UI platforms for the desktop, web and mobile, applications, and then services, before I made the move to working on modern SaaS platforms with a focus on dynamic work. After Microsoft, I moved to 10000ft, a startup building resource management software, and have been at Smartsheet since 2019. I am passionate about building rich, responsive experiences that customers can enjoy using while also getting their work done. My focus now is building and leading diverse teams with a breadth of experience and knowledge, and in helping my teams find joy in their work and their career paths.
