Many senior technical leaders are struggling with how to make sure that their infrastructure, code and architecture can support the business needs. The challenge is not WHAT should be done, but how to promote these tasks, how to create a unified backlog that everyone agrees on, and how to keep the right communication level with the company’s CEO, VP Product and other non-technical managers. These aspects of the system, includes security, scaling, supportability, debuggability, it's up time and more.

As a senior engineering manager, your role is to manage and prioritize these required changes as a backlog that must be tightly aligned with the company’s business needs.

In this workshop, we will understand how to manage all the technical items that can enable your business growth, what the preferred method to create the right balance for your own company is, and how to make everyone in your organization follow the same decision-making process. By gaining these techniques, you will be able to not only provide a clear technical roadmap to your system, but also communicate it well to the business people, to keep everyone on the same page for your team’s plans for next year.
