We handled a lot of large-scale, highly complex changes in the past 2 years. HTTPS, Moving to Kubernetes, Bazel. They may each have their own implementation details, but the principle of how to manage these changes in a live system are all the same. We will use examples from our previous projects to demonstrate these principles, and hopefully, our audience will manage their own changes better next time.
