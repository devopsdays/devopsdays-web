So, the firefighters are in your data center, this is not a drill. There is no electricity, and the pager is more like a DDoS attack on your phone. You look at your watch, multiple thoughts running through your head. Why me? Why now? How do you pull the team out and through this catastrophe?

In this session we will look at managing a crisis of significant magnitude, where all the organization is impacted and there is no clear path through to resolution. We will review the following: - The culture of a learning organization going into the crisis. - Crisis management “in action” - Running a blameless post mortem - Creating tools for high engagement to support the crisis manager. During the presentation we will share real life events, such as a data center going dark with real firefighters coming to the rescue, and production services in the cloud that stop responding.
