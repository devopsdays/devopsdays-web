Security people say users are the weakest link. But are they? When complying with security becomes too burdensome, users take shortcuts, find workarounds, and end up jeopardizing security. Blaming users is lazy and easy. Making security usable is time consuming and challenging. How does design research help us understand our customers? What patterns and principles drive secure behavior? How can we build empathy with customers and make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do? This session explores these questions, and provides examples of how design thinking and research can help us be more secure. We will walk through our creation of core user personas, design principles, and how these inform and direct our design choices and intent. Donâ€™t blame your users anymore. Come learn how to be part of a future where usability leads security.
