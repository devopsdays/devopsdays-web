We all know how hard it is to find DevOps engineers, and creating a diverse team despite gender and ethnicity bias? Nearly impossible. At this talk we will show our tools and methods implemented in the Develeap hiring process that overcome this inherited bias.

About 2 years ago we faced a crisis in our DevOps consulting company - the market demand was higher than we could supply. The traditional recruiting process depending on CV and artificial credentials was not working. So we came up with an alternative solution, and since then - we are growing exponentially and diversely. In this talk we will show the practical tools we deployed in order to increase our capacity, and we will show how these tools overcome the inherited bias in the process.
