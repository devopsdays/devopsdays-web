If you have never used GraphQL before, you probably think that it is just another buzzword that will be forgotten in a few years. You might think: “Why do I need to learn a new way to write APIs when REST already answers all my needs?”. Or, you are excited to learn something new but don’t believe GraphQL is mature enough for production.

In this talk, I will remind you of some of the pain points you have probably experienced when using REST. I will then explain what GraphQL is and demonstrate how it solves these pain points. Next, I will discuss the disadvantages of GraphQL. Finally, I will provide some guidelines for choosing between REST and GraphQL. By the end of this talk, you will understand what GraphQL is and when to use it.
