Presenting the concept of spiral history in computer technology, with very little examples. spiral history is a metaphor for how we do the same stuff every few years but they work out a little bit different.
“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” or so it is said, in technology and even more specifically in computer science it still holds true, however in computer science it is not exactly repeating and sometimes in our very young field forgetting the past actually helps since what haven’t worked before might work today. 5 minutes for 2 examples of spiral history and i hope you will accept this theory.
