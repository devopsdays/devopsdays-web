From idea to execution, the challenges of publishing an open source project are very similar to initializing a startup when it comes to creating a successful product that people will love and use.

Most open source projects are not “taking-off”, although they are really good! This is because developers (which are usually the creators of open source projects) think that writing the code is the hard part and “neglect” the other parts of publishing a good open source project.

In this talk, I will use my experience as a contributor to open source and product head of a startup, to go beyond writing the code itself and cover the other central aspects of creating an open source project, like MVP, product/market fit, marketing and more.
