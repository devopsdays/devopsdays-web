In this talk, I will share do's and don'ts on how to onboard successfully in a remote or hybrid setup including moving to a leadership role, speaking from my own journey onboarding remotely in the midst of a global pandemic.

I will share the tips that worked for me for successful onboarding, how I was able to be productive, impactful, and make a good impression on others. The key issues as an “onbordee” that I will talk about are how to create relationships, make yourself visible in the company, time management, and more.

Since I started working in Augury over 100 new employees have joined the company. Each month I give a session that is part of their general onboarding process. This became a crucial step due to the fact that we are now a hybrid company and a lot of people are onboarding remotely or in a hybrid setup for the first time in their lives.

I joined the company as a backend developer and a few months into my role, the squad leader position in my squad was up for grabs and I was fortunate enough to grab it :) This is my first official leadership role, which I also needed to onboard into in a hybrid setup. I will share the process that I built for myself on “How to lead”. Also, a word or two on the process we built as a squad on how we work in a hybrid setup, what are we optimizing for when we do meet and how to include new members of the team.
