Title = "BUILDING A DR PLAN FOR YOUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE GROUND UP"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["moshe-ben-shoham"]
+++

This is a story about taking the cloud infrastructure of a successful company, that is still managed as infrastructure of a startup company, and rebuilding it to support the growing business requirements, especially around disaster recovery and business continuity. In the session I will share Next Insuranceâ€™s journey - where we started, where we are now and what we learned on the way so far. I will talk about how we managed to build our proven DR plans, and actually execute them in our DR drills. I will also talk about why we decided that the only way to prove your DR plan works is to continue running your business in the DR account and make it your production account, and go on to build your next DR account. If you are a part of a company that is about to embark on a similar journey, this session might equip you with some very useful insights on how to think about such a challenge, and some very useful and practical tips on how to execute it.
