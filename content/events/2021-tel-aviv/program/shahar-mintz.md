Configuration Management is at the core of Ops. Itâ€™s the biggest enabler of any compute operation, small and big. In the past decade, we have switched from thinking about the machines we are configuring, to think about the software and services we are controlling. With that change of mindset, so did the tools we are using. Traditional tools like Puppet, chef, salt and Ansible are slowly declining while new tools such as Terraform, Pulumi, Helm and Kustomize are on the rise. In this talk I will try to describe the pain-points and the opportunities of this transformation as well as suggesting a future direction based on tools developed at the big-tech companies (Mainly facebook and google)
