The last two decades have been all about SaaS, with advantages that cannot be overstated. Except SaaS isn’t always an option, nor is it always the right choice: businesses in tightly regulated industries, or where information security is paramount, for example, will not - often can not - consider any software that isn’t under their control. For many software enterprises, this leads to the dreaded inevitability of on-premise deployment.

Fortunately, the situation today is dramatically different to a scant few years ago, let alone a decade or two: the same technologies that enable SaaS have also radically transformed on-prem deployment. Modern tools like Docker, Consul, ELK and Kubernetes - to name a few - can be leveraged to completely transform the experience for both customers and vendors. In this talk we’ll contrast the challenges and advantages of SaaS and on-prem, see how things have evolved in recent history, and see how modern on-prem deployment can be, if not pleasurable, at least relatively painless.
