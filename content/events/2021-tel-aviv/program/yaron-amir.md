In 2019, Yaron, quit his job, left his home and bought a one way ticket to Thailand, a one-year trip was planned, wellâ€¦ man plans and COVID coughs in their face.
One year of travelling turned into two, and three months in Vietnam turned into a year and a half.
In this talk, I will give you an inside look at traveling with kids, how remote work looks when it's really really remote.
I will give you advice on taking the first steps into becoming a digital nomad and will share the lesson learned ( if there is one ) from my experience.
