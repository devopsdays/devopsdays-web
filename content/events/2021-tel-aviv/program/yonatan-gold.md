Everyone wants observability into their system, but find themselves with too many vendors and tools, each with its own API, SDK, agent and collectors.

With the increasing complexity of modern applications, continuous profiling methods and tools are gaining popularity among the Developer and Engineering communities. In this session, we cover what continuous profiling entails and why you should implement a profiler into your tech stack (if you haven’t done so already). We’ll then bring theory to practice and demonstrate a real-life scenario using gProfiler, a free open-source continuous profiling tool, covering Linux servers on multiple architectures (such as Graviton).
