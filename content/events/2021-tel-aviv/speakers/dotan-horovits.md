“TRYING IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS FAILURE”, SAID THE GREAT HOMER SIMPSON AND I WOULD ADD THAT “FAILING IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS”.
I’VE BEEN AROUND SOFTWARE SINCE 2006, IN VARIOUS COMPANIES AND POSITIONS, FROM C4 SYSTEM FOR INTERCEPTING ROCKETS THROUGH E-COMMERCE AND AD-TECH.
I'M ALWAYS KEEN TO LEARN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TEST THEM TO SEE HOW FAR TO THE EDGE I CAN TAKE THEM. I PRACTICE THIS PASSION BY DAY AT TABOOLA WITH OUR TEAM OF ROCKSTARS, WHILE BY NIGHT I SPEND TIME ON MY SECOND PASSION - BREWING MY OWN BEER.
