Ellen is Founder in Residence at boldstart Ventures. She joined the boldstart team in January 2021, after having worked with the team as a founder at Dark. Her role allows her to do exactly what she loves â€“ some investing and hands-on support for founders building pre-product, dev-focused, enterprise companies.

Prior to boldstart and founding Dark, she worked at Blade as an EIR, seeding the work for what became Lola. She also worked on backer-facing projects at Kickstarter and on the first versions of Office for non-Microsoft phone platforms. The common thread is building tools that help people to do creative work.

Ellen has an a M.B.A from Harvard Business School, and a B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. She grew up in Rochester Hills, MI, but now lives in Somerville, MA with her husband and her cat, Gutenberg.
