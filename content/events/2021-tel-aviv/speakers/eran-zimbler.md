From a young age I know iâ€™m going to be in tech. And i was right. i should have believed i am going to be rich without working instead. I have worked in big companies (checkpoint software, AVG israel) and in small startups (Rumble news, Cloud of things) and Dev centers for Enterprises (BNY Mellon, and Alibaba) usually improving things, and helping the process of development to be going in the right direction. Also i am a 3d printing enthusiast but very bad at it (ruined another hotend x2)
