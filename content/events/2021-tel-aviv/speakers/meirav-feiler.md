My name is Meirav and I am the Engineering Director of npm which is owned by GitHub. In the past year me and my teams have been working hard on improving npmâ€™s CI/CD process moving from old tools and manual scripts to a fully automated CI/CD flow using GitHub. In this process we have learned a lot and I will try in my talk to share those learning and give our best practices.
