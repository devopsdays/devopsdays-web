HELLO! I’M ORI KEREN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER AT LINEARB. I GOT MY FIRST CODING JOB IN 1999 AND EVENTUALLY BECAME VP OF ENGINEERING FOR MULTIPLE START-UPS BEFORE STARTING MY OWN COMPANY. BEFORE ALL THAT, MY FIRST EXPERIENCE PROGRAMMING WAS IN BASIC. IN 1987 I WAS IN 5TH GRADE. MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME A SINCLAIR SPECTRUM ZX WITH 48K RAM. I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE DAY I GOT THAT MACHINE. A FIRE LIT INSIDE ME AND IT NEVER WENT AWAY :-) THAT’S WHY I DO THIS JOB.
