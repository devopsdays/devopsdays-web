IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, I’VE BEEN ON A QUEST TO BUILD A BETTER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL, TRYING TO LEARN HOW DIFFERENT COMPANIES IMPLEMENTING THEIR CONFIGURATION STRATEGIES. I AM EVALUATING HOW CONFIGURATION IS BEING DESCRIBED, COMPOSED, DELIVERED AND CONSUMED WHILE DEVELOPING PROTOCONF. I’VE STARTED PROTOCONF BECAUSE I MISSED THE CONFIGURATION TOOL I USED WHILE AT FACEBOOK (CONFIGERATOR). I FEEL LIKE MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HOW BIG-TECH COMPANIES APPROACH CONFIGURATION.
