SR. TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIST @ MICROSOFT. CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR THE SWEET SPOT WHERE 1ST AND 3RD PARTY SOLUTIONS COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER AND WORKING WITH SAAS VENDORS AND STARTUPS TO DEPLOY THEIR MAGIC ON OUR CLOUD PLATFORM. I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTERS SCIENCE AND MASTERS IN BUSINESS, TRANSITIONED FROM FULL STACK TO TECH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, SO ESSENTIALLY I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER ANSWERING "WILL THIS SCALE?" QUESTIONS.
