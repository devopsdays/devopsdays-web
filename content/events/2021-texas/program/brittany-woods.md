By now we’re all doing “the DevOps”, but what happens when things start to go off the rails? Have you taken a wrong turn in your implementation? How will you even know if a wrong turn was taken? During this talk, I would like to share three key areas; tool creep, top-down and directive DevOps, and aversion to standards, where a DevOps implementation can go off the rails. I also intend to discuss how you, the DevOps practitioner, can use your unique role, experience, and expertise to aid in keeping your organization on a healthy, paved DevOps path.
