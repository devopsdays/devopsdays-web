My name is Alina Domanov, I am 23 years old and I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I am a DevOps Engineer at Cognizant Softvision, with experience on different cloud providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
At a technological level, I used Kubernetes for the container orchestration and Docker for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications.
I consider myself a person who likes challenges and who learns quickly. My experience with Kubernetes in PaaS stands out in the development of solutions with Terraform to achieve the automation of the clusters creation.
