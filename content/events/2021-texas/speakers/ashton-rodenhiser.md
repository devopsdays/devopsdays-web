Ashton Rodenhiser is passionate about lifting the creative spirit in everyone that she meets. For the past seven years, she has followed her passion for helping people communicate their ideas and combined that with creativity by founding Mind's Eye Creative Consulting.

You’ll often find her with markers in hand as she’s helping bring ideas to life through graphic recording and graphic facilitation practices.

She’s worked with diverse groups, from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies. It may appear as if she’s the silent illustrator in the room. In fact, she’s helping to break down complex concepts and notions into an easily understandable visual language, helping others retain more information while inspiring people to continue practicing her techniques in the world.

Over the years, she has brought close to a thousand presentations and conversations to life either on paper or digitally.

When she’s not working with clients, she’s being silly with her three young kids and husband in rural Canada.
