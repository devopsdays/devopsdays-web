Brittany Woods is an automator of things based in central Missouri. During her career in technical roles spanning across both the financial and the automotive sector, Brittany has been a major advocate for utilizing DevOps and automation to enhance velocity, increase innovation, and drive business value. She enjoys work that spans not only across DevOps and automation spaces but also into systems architecture and cloud solutions and adoption as well. Additionally, Brittany enjoys teaching others, sharing knowledge through conference speaking, and leading teams.

When sheâ€™s not automating the things, Brittany enjoys the casual binge watch on your favorite streaming service, lazy weekends, clarinet and bass guitar playing, and home improvement projects.

Brittany is currently a Lead Cloud Automation Engineer with H&R Block.
