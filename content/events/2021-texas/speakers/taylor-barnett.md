Taylor Barnett is a Senior Community Engineer at <a href="https://www.transposit.com/">Transposit</a>. She is passionate about building great technical user experiences with an emphasis on empathy within Product and Documentation and spends a considerable amount of time thinking about API integrations.

After leaving software engineering roles at a couple of companies, Taylor led Developer Relations at Stoplight and worked with the developer community, SDKs, and documentation at Keen. She has spoken at conferences such as O'Reilly OSCON, GlueCon, API Strategy & Practice, and DevXcon. She is currently the program chair of the API Specifications Conference.

In her free time, she's either climbing rocks with friends, trying to find the funkiest sour beers, or hanging out with her corgi, Yoda, in Austin, Texas.
