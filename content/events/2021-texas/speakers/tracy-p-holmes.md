A "jackie of all trades" (and mistress of being herself), Tracy has experienced both sides of HashiCorpâ€™s Terraform - as a Software Engineer and now a Developer Advocate. When she isn't speaking or leveling up her programming skills to make the Terraform ecosystem even better, she likes baking, volunteering, hanging with her pup, and reading mysteries. She is a strong believer that open source is like gardening - pay attention to your conditions, and water only when needed.
