Oftentimes, IT professionals think auditability and observability are separate concepts, when in fact, they’re two sides of the same coin. It’s the review of what happened and why - just from different perspectives and moments in time. The point is, building an auditable pipeline should also result in building an observable pipeline. 

Most IT pros, however, think about observability in regards to the observability of an operational system. But what if we considered the observability of an internal organizational system instead? For example, the CI cycle time of your pipeline.

To test this hypothesis, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) approaches can be applied to pinpoint what metrics we care about most and how to align context with desired outcomes.

During my talk, I will share how to place service level objectives (SLO’s), indicators (SLIs), and agreements (SLA’s) into different parts of your Software Delivery Lifecycle. You will learn how to make your pipeline metrics adjacent to auditability and observability standards as part of any continuous improvement process.
