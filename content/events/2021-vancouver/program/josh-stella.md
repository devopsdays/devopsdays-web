In order to keep your cloud data secure, you have to get inside the minds of those seeking to breach it. 
Josh Stella explores who cloud attackers are, what motivates them, and the tools and methods they use to exploit our cloud environments and data. 
Josh is going to simulate two real-world cloud misconfiguration attacks to demonstrate in real-time how these methods work in evading datacenter security approaches and take advantage of common cloud misconfigurations that compliance standards miss.
If your competitors are still mired in that big mess of tedious, repetitive manual security and compliance tasks, you can move faster than they can. Not only will you reduce serious risks to your organization, you’ll turn security and compliance into a competitive advantage.  


You’ll learn how these hacks go down
