The abrupt rise of work-from-home in 2020 is one of the biggest changes the software development community has ever experienced. As big as the Agile and DevOps movements.

Agile helped us eliminate slow, waterfall development and validation cycles. DevOps helped us close the delivery gap. And the global pandemic of 2020 forced our teams to deliver value and to stay connected to business and customers while in different locations at different times.

We call this new way of working Asynchronous Development. Async Dev builds on the innovations from Agile and DevOps and adds new ideas and practices to help make hybrid remote dev teams successful in 2020.
