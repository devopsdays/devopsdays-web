I've never been called the Rick Mercer of Bash scripting, but I'm going to give it a go. Some pros, some cons some hard lessons learned and some tips and tricks. You know, some advice from me for me. I want to bring you along on the journey as we pick apart the love and the hate for shell scripting, touch on POSIX, linting and some awful bash scripts I've written.
