Ori Keren is the CEO and Co-founder at LinearB. Additionally, Ori Keren has had 3 past jobs including VP of Advanced Development & Cyber Intelligence at CloudLock. He found his passion in computing when his parents bought him a Sinclair Spectrum ZX with 48k RAM. At that moment, a fire was lit inside of him that has never left. He got his first developer job in 2000 and eventually became VP of Engineering. Then, two years ago, he started LinearB with his friend Dan Lines. As CEO he doesnâ€™t get to write as much code as he used to but loves helping other dev leaders translate engineering activity to business success through data and metrics.
