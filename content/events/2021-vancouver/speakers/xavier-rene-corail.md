After 10 years as a software developer, then 10 years implementing best practices for a team of 250 developers (Agile principles, shifting left quality, devops culture ...), I am now leading the GitHub Security Lab, building bridges between the security researchers and developers community, to help secure open source software. I am also a founding member of the Open Source Security Foundation.
I love to share my experience at conferences (XP Days Benelux 2016, 2017, 2018, OracleOne 2018, Geecon Krakow 2018)
