        <p>The COVID-19 situation in Switzerland is improving at this point in time, so that we're go for an in-person event allowing access to everyone who is either vaccinated, tested or convalesced from COVID-19. 
        <b>This means that only persons with a valid COVID-Certificate and a valid ID (e.g. driving license or passport) are allowed access to the DevOpsDays Zürich 2021.</b>
