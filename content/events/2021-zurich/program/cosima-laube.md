### Workshop

During my career in IT and people development I had several turning points where I either was made to use journaling techniques or experimented with them myself to successfully tackle the next challenge. Over the years I reflected why those 'written self-reflection' techniques are so powerful and – at the same time – they are still quite rarely used in the business context.

In this session I will happily share my experience and my findings backened by a scientific psychological model with you!
