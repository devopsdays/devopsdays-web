### Ignite

We talk a lot about the quality of software. Or more accurately we talk about the
lack of quality in software. We try to introduce automated tests,
deployments, we do _agile_, _continuous delivery_ and _DevOps_, but has that made our software
better?

I have trust in a rock to behave as expected, I can not save the same thing for the average piece of software.
In this talk I will talk about what the concept of _quality_ means in terms of software.
I will also cover techniques for reasoning about the quality of our software, and hopefully make it better.
