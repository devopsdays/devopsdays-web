### Talk

why hack into something when you could just ask for access? Undetectable by firewalls and antivirus software, social engineering relies on human fault to gain access to sensitive spaces;

Every big organization has a layer by layer defense of data. If all the controls are well placed and active, then also it is vulnerable. One of the biggest failures in this is either you can bypass the controls or start penetrating the layers. Once you penetrate the first layer successfully, the next layer will be easier. Most of the defense mechanisms fail because of Human error or Social Engineering which brings about the conclusion “Human is the weakest chain in security”.

Let’s focus a little bit on hackers, many view us with the power to hack anything in mere seconds. While that is frequently true on websites due to how cruddy things are programmed, things are getting better.
At the end of this session, I would have successfully explained the science of hacking, misconceptions of hacking, and finally, a quick demo on how the best developers can be victims of hacking.
