### Talk

Many of our conversations on DevOps revolve around tools and practices - but very few address the where the two meet.

We can talk about monitoring, analytics, alerting, on-call and the philosophies surrounding them, but how do we bring the two worlds together?

This talk will focus on successful setups and all the parts and tools that go into it. How do we make sure we have everything we need for our organization. Weâ€™ll also discuss how to get the buy-in needed from your team to make it work.
