### Keynote

It has been over 10 years now that the DevOps community started getting together and define best practices for developing and operating software. Now that our entire stack seems to have been re-invented, how relevant is DevOps ? Did we lose ourselves by choosing tools for fashion ? Did we really build organizations that can adapt to change ? Did we really build a culture of empathy ? In this talk, we will take a critical look at technology and our human tendencies and digress on whether we are following technology or technology is following us.
