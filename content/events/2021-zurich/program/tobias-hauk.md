### Ignite

Providing feedback to employees is a core activity for every leader and manager. In the past, managers were the instance of authority, involved in every important project and they mostly kept the overview about who is doing what in the team. With Agile and DevOps this changes into a self-organizing team where the manager role changes significantly. The manager is no longer the person that is involved in all topics. This also impacts the way the manager and the entire team should think and act about employee feedback. In this talk you will learn, based on real life experience, how managers could successfully transform the way they handle employee feedback in modern Agile or DevOps teams.
