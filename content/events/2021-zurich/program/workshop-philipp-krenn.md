### Workshop

Tracing and telemetry are popular topics right now, but the development is so quick that it also confuses:

* Starting with OpenTracing, then W3C Trace-Context, and now OpenTelemetry there are plenty of standards, but what do or don't they cover?
* How do the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its projects like Jaeger play into that.
* Where is OpenTelemetry headed, and how can projects tie into it?

This talk gives an overview of standards, projects, and how they all tie together.
