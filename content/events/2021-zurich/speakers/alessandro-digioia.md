### Co-Founder & Sociotechnical Coach at Alcor Academy
In the past 20 years, Alessandro has helped organizations (from small start-ups to large enterprises) to embrace Agile technical practices, working in Italy, Norway, and recently in London, UK.

He is a practitioner of eXtreme Programming (XP), therefore he likes concise, expressive, readable code in either object-oriented or functional style. He is always looking for better ways of designing asynchronous distributed architectures.

Although Alessandro considers himself a forever learner, he is also a coach and a mentor because he loves to share his experience.
