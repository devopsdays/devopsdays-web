### Agile Engineering and DevSecOps Advocate
I am currently a DevSecOps Experience Manager here at Delta. In my current role, I have setup the development standards for Delta in line with our short term and long term vision. I regularly organize and facilitate enterprise wide developer discussions on various range of topics. I also develop and conduct, both in person and video based corporate training on the newest tools and technology. I work periodically work with Enterprise Architecture group to evaluate and create proposals for adoption of latest technologies at Delta.

I have been at Delta for 15+ years. Over the years I have enjoyed various roles Project Architect, Scrum Master, Senior Developer working on frontend and backend applications, SOAP, and API services. I like learning new things as well as participating in innovation challenges. Off work you can often find me at various meetups around Atlanta.
