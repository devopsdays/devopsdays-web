### monum GmbH, Agile Coach
In 10 years of working as a project manager and consultant in IT, Claudine has become convinced that today's complex problems can no longer be adequately dealt with using classic working methods. She first dealt with new work methods, self-organization, systemic thinking and Scrum before she completed a postgraduate degree in Change Management and was trained as a Holacracy Facilitator. Since three years she is coaching teams and managers in their various transformation projects towards Agile. She is a partner at monum GmbH.
