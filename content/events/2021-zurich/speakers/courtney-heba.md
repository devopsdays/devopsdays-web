### Senior Technical Specialist, Microsoft
Seasoned Agile leader driving transformation at Carters | Oshkosg B'gosh. My role is to accelerate the visibility of 2021 strategic initiatives to leaders in both IT and business through facilitation of Roadmap and Quarterly (PI) Planning sessions, where we seek to align on goals, highlight risks, and acknowledge dependencies. My work setting up the governance of Jira (our agile collaboration tool) has allowed all scrum and kanban teams to be consistent on how they plan for epics, features, and user stories. Metrics per team is something I am very passionate about and I have set each scrum and kanban team up in JIRA to allow me to report on predictability, performance, quality, and scope creep. Over the years I have developed my own Agile Training courses ranging from Agile for Leaders, Intro to Agile, Teaming, Estimation and incorporate one training per week during new agile team lift offs.

Previously, I was an Agile Coach at Delta Air Lines, helping with our Enterprise Transformation. As a member of the Agile Center of Excellence I also worked a year at Delta's dojo. While at Dojo, I coached 26 Scrum Masters and facilitated 30 training courses in topics ranging from Intro to Agile to Estimation to Teaming. Helping teams work more effectively is one of my passions, which led me to pilot Mob Programming at Deltaâ€™s Dojo. To date, I have led training for over 120 participants who are now actively mobbing. Previously, I worked at AT&T in Corporate Technology Sales with a background in account management selling B2B network infrastructure (fiber) and mobile applications.

To supplement my love for helping others grow, I teach one night a week at Georgia Gwinnett College C# and MIS courses. I am also a Georgia Tech MBA graduate with a 6 Sigma Black belt that I use often to streamline inefficient processes.
