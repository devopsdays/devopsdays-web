### Agile Transformation and Project Manager at Swiss Air-Rescue Rega
Throughout Georg’s career, he has been working in quite diverse fields, such as wireless telemetry, satellite communications, software architecture, cost steering and, ultimately, project management. Somehow, he ended up at Swiss Air-Rescue Rega, a private, non-profit air rescue service. Not that he would regret it.

At Rega, Georg is responsible for managing IT services related to helicopter rescue operations and, on top, ground-based mountain rescue. Having experienced the power (and fun) of agile collaboration firsthand, he is also supporting Rega’s agile transformation. Georg is currently working towards a digital transformation of rescue operations that ranges from the patients themselves to the helicopter and ground crews.

In 10 years of working as a project manager and consultant in IT, Claudine has become convinced that today's complex problems can no longer be adequately dealt with using classic working methods. She first dealt with new work methods, self-organization, systemic thinking and Scrum before she completed a postgraduate degree in Change Management and was trained as a Holacracy Facilitator.
