### DevOps Consultant
I am a Continuous Delivery and DevOps consultant and teacher. I did not write the book on DevOps, but I did write the song for DevOpsDays Copenhagen. I help companies both with process and culture, but I do enjoy it when I can dive into the deep tech stuff. I am particular fond of Git, Jenkins, Artifactory and Gradle as a toolstack.
I maintain [Opinionated Git](http://opinionatedgit.com), [Exploring Agile Newsletter](http://abildskov.io/agile/) and the [best darn Git exercises around](https://github.com/praqma-training/git-katas). I enjoy programming, music, gaming and being with my family of course ðŸ™‚
