### Co-Founder & Sociotechnical Coach at Alcor Academy
Software craftsman, technical coach, international speaker, Systems thinker, symmathecist, philosopher - all mixed with some Venetian humor.
Co-author of the award-winning book "Agile Technical Practices Distilled - A learning journey in technical practices and principles of software design".
I self-learned Basic on a Commodore when I was 9 and my passion for programming has never faded since. I have been working for the past 20 years between Italy and UK, embracing ideas from Lean, Agile, eXtreme Programming, Domain-Driven Design, and Systems Thinking.
I recently co-founded Alcor Academy with the mission of helping technical leaders to create a culture of engineering excellence through training on Agile Technical Practices.
