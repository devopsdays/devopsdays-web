**Ignite Talk**

This is a talk about me and my team’s obsession with promoting a team culture of releasing our biggest software product every single day. It’s about how to remove as much risk, reluctance, intimidation, and manual process as possible, making every team member comfortable releasing a many-million-requests-per-month, zero-downtime API Gateway every time they’ve made a minor change to its code.

The underlying theme is one of automating all of the scary parts that make you fearful of releasing, while coping with various Enterprise and legacy requirements.
