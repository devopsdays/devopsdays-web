Come join us for a session about how the LEGO Group are using modern architecture to enable DevOps and autonomy for everything we do. This session will discuss how the 90 years old company has moved beyond "Digital Transformation" into being digital with a strong technology muscle. We will cover topics on how API's and Cloud are the magic ingredient for good architecture and how autonomy makes us move faster.
