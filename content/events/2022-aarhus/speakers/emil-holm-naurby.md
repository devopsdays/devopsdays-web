My name is Emil Holm Nauerby and I work as a senior software developer for Salling Group’s digital department in a small team of 4 full-time developers that develop, release, and operate a large API Gateway. I have a particular interest in building a strong team culture around frequent and fearless releases, keeping our processes simple and friendly for all, and in automating our cloud setup in Azure. I’ve been part of our API Gateway team from its humble beginnings to its current state as a fundamental piece of our digital service architecture.
