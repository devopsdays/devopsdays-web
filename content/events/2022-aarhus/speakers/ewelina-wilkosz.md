I started as a web developer in 2007 and soon switched to software development for about 6 years. Somewhere along the way I discovered that automating things and making developers' lives easier made my work fun. I then spent almost 5 years as a CI/CD consultant for embedded software companies where the whole process relied heavily on hardware, which was an additional challenge. 
Currently I'm working as a DevOps Engineer in Customer Success and Developer Relations at Merkely and I'm a Jenkins Governance Board member.
