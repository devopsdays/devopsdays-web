Our industry - software development - has a bad reputation that “you can get away with anything - and fix it later”. I’m on a mission; I want that reputation to change. I advocate that software should be “done-done” when it’s shipped, as opposed to just plain “done”. And I claim that it’s not even difficult - I’m a Continuous Delivery Evangelist.

I want to change the world, to the better - at least the part of it that runs on software. I believe that Open Source is right, from both an idealistic, efficiency and feasibility point of view. I advocate Open Source. It’s literally good - as opposed to evil!

I’m a specialized generalist: I strive to know a lot about many things - I’m a sucker for knowledge, I research, investigate, experiment, read, evaluate and innovate. I have a masters degree in Computer Science, Communications and Business Coaching.

I’ve worked in software since before the turn of the millenium.

I’ve worked as a contractor for of bunch of huge international corporations - as well as small entrepreneurships and startups - initially as an employed consultant, later as self-employed. I co-founded - and sold off - Praqma - The Continuous Delivery Company. I co-founded - and sold off - Phable - a design and branding agency in London. I founded Prolike, a master/apprentice workplace for young independent professionals (yipees) and latest I founded inc inc - offering lean business development and tech advise.
