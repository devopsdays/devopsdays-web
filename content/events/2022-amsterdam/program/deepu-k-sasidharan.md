WebAssembly has brought some great innovations to the Web. But lately, it has been finding its way to Kubernetes and cloud-native due to its efficiency & security. WebAssembly opens up a lot of possibilities in the cloud-native ecosystem and is a great alternative to containers. But if you are not familiar with WebAssembly it may all sound daunting and foreign. I'm here to break it all down and show you why it matters, how it works and what benefits it offers. We will look at how to get started with WebAssembly on Kubernetes using Krustlet, WasmEdge, and so on. We will look at implementations, use cases, and some examples. Get ready for an exciting ride.
