How do you enable global scaling of a Cloud platform that is created by one small DevOps team? This is the question Albert Heijn's Cloud hosting team faced, when other operating companies within Ahold Delhaize wanted to use the Cloud framework developed by Albert Heijn. Within less than a year, the team's focus shifted from delivering new functionality requested by business teams, to operating as code maintainers of a framework used by colleagues around the globe. Leveraging the learnings from opensource projects, Albert Heijn developed an innersource model suited to the needs of their global Cloud platform.
