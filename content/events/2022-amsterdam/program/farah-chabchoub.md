Your company is starting to scale, the number of incidents is increasing from release to release, customer complaints are piling up, and you think it's the right time to build a quality culture, but you don't know where to start?
Implementing quality of service culture requires education and change management practices, especially in a fast-growing environment. Having joined MANGOPAY in 2017, I had the experience of being the only QA for a team of 40 people and succeeded in changing mindsets about the positioning and value of quality with perceptible added value at all levels of the company.
In this talk, I tell you my story and share with you all the levers I was able to implement to support scalability through quality!
