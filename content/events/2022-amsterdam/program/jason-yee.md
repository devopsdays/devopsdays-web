DevOps is supposed to be a culture of collaboration between teams, but in practice most organizations still limit this “collaboration” to the handoffs when software moves from devs to QA to ops. Or worse, the “collaboration” is just the DevOps team automating these handoffs.

True collaboration requires teams to have influence in the entire software lifecycle.

The Request for Comments (RFC) process is a commonly used method to gain consensus during software planning. In this session, I’ll discuss what RFCs are, best practices for running RFCs, and how to apply DevOps to the process and build better cross organizational collaboration.
