At Kabisa/Cloud Legends we have a Managed Services team, which on one hand handles all incidents, an on the other hand is able to work on new infrastructures, developing new features for (web)applications, etc. In this Lightning talk, I want to give some tips and share experiences about how to organise such teams and motivate them to function properly, and at the same time, not get overworked.
