Our opening Keynote is presented by Emily Freeman.

Tech has spent ages treating incidents as something engineers can respond to, measure, even prevent. But what would happen if we accepted incidents as part of the software development lifecycle? 

In this talk I’ll turn incident management on its head and suggest an entirely different approach — treating incidents as business as usual. I’ll discuss the importance of celebrating failure and how to utilize incidents to galvanize and empower your teams.
