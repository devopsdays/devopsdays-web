Q: How do you move hundreds of interconnected applications, databases, queues and whatnot from your data centre to the cloud?
A: Like how you eat an elephant, one bite at a time.

But where do you start? How fast can you go? What tools and people do you need? How do you keep track of progress? What are the caveats? How do you prevent failure?

Piet knows and he can't wait to tell you. He will take you through the seemingly monstrous task and show you how he helped one of his clients move 100+ applications to the cloud without breaking much of a sweat. He even had a lot of fun doing it. Bonus: he open sourced the migration tools he created, so you can do it too!
