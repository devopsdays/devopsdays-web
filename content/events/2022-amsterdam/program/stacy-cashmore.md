As developers, we want to work in a modern way, to get fast feedback on what we are building to make sure that we are building the right things in the right way.

However, many companies are still at the start of their journey. Things take longer than we would like to get moving, sometimes change can seem to happen at a glacial pace and whilst you are ready to try and run, others are finding their feet - or even digging in their heels!

In this talk, we will go over some of the pitfalls that have happened during this journey, and the lessons learned from them. Unfortunately, there are no magic solutions to make the problems go away, but hopefully, you can look at the mistakes made and go away to make your own new ones to learn from!
