“Principles aren’t principles when you pick and choose when you’re gonna follow them." – Chidi Anagonye, The Good Place

Have you ever been in a gnarly situation where you really struggled to make a decision? Should I go left or should I go right? Should I go over or should I go under?? Should I stay or should I go??? And at the end of it, how do you know whether what you chose to do was ‘right’?

Big dilemmas can get us pretty worked up, and when the emotions roll in, we often let our instincts take over, while our brains forget to think. Ethics is the difference between what you have a right to do and what the right thing is. Ethics ain’t easy, but having a framework to look at complex situations supports us enables us to put the emotions to one side, and consider things more objectively. In this session we will face some big dilemmas, explore the idea of making decisions with ‘good’ reasons, and discuss how to guide and coach others to develop their ethical reasoning.
