What do you do when your Kubernetes cluster stops working?

As more teams and organizations adopt Kubernetes, more developers and operators are taking on the responsibility of keeping their clusters happy and healthy. While there's lots of information online for getting started and extending Kubernetes, there's not a lot that focuses on debugging and handling outages; enter Klustered.

In this workshop, we will live debug some clusters broken by members of the Kubernetes community; showing the methods and techniques to establish which component has a problem, how to determine the root cause, and apply a fix to get the cluster operational.
