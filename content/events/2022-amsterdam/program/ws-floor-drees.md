Arjen de Ruiter and Jomiro Eming launched the Technical Debt Game in 2021, a game that teaches you how to leverage and control technical debt!

In software development, technical debt is the cost of rework you need to do, to keep a system functional in the long run. It could either be the result of taking shortcuts, which pile up code that you need to come back to later; or, it could also be the result of changing requirements - for example, you have more users than you expected, and now you have performance issues.

Even though technical debt is often seen as negative, itâ€™s not always a bad thing: the shortcuts you take now might speed up your development, and give you a first-mover advantage. You need to figure out how to strike the right balance!
