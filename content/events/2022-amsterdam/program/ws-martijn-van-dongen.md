In this workshop, we learn Terraform based on a practical AWS use case. It starts with a simple S3 bucket, and at the end we deployed a stack with a lot of services, tools and best practices, all in Terraform. It’s highly recommended that you’re already familiar with AWS, AWS CLI, basic Linux commands, and IaC in general (e.g. CloudFormation), because this workshop is at a really high pace. The workshop material will remain available for participants after the workshop, so you can use it as a cheat sheet and to finish (additional) exercises. Important; bring your own laptop and an AWS sandbox account.
