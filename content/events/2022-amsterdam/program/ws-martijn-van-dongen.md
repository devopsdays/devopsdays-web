**Important: bring your own laptop with VSCode, Terraform and AWS CLI v2 installed. An AWS Sandbox Account will be provided.**

In this workshop, we learn Terraform based on a practical AWS use case. It starts with a S3 bucket, and at the end we deployed a stack with a lot of services, tools and best practices, all in Terraform. It’s highly recommended that you’re already familiar with AWS, AWS CLI, basic Linux commands, and IaC in general (for example CloudFormation), because this workshop is at a really high pace. The workshop material will remain available for participants after the workshop, so you can use it as a cheat sheet and to finish (additional) exercises. Important; bring your own laptop and an AWS sandbox account.
