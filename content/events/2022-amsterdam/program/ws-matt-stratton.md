In this hands-on workshop, we’ll examine how Pulumi works with Kubernetes, and show real-world examples of managing Amazon EKS clusters. We’ll focus on building a user-friendly Kubernetes platform and deploy your first EKS cluster using Pulumi’s new multi-language EKS SDK.

Next, we’ll examine Pulumi’s automation API and leverage its powerful capabilities to deliver your application deployment platform into your users’ hands without asking them to write a single line of code!

Pulumi is an open-source tool that allows users to write their infrastructure code in TypeScript, Python, DotNet, or Go. General-purpose languages allow infrastructure code to have integrated testing, compile-time checks as well as be able to create infrastructure APIs and is more suited to infrastructure management than DSLs, JSON, or YAML.
