Let's play a game!

We will start the workshop with a short keynote. The keynote introduces you to the core concepts of Site Reliability Engineering and practical tips on getting started. After the keynote, we will play the SRE game. During the SRE game, you need to apply the knowledge you have gained during the keynote to help a fictive organization increase the reliability of its systems without stopping to deliver new features.

After the game, we will reflect on the teams' performance and explain the optimal strategy to help the fictive organization. We will close the session with a small prize ceremony providing the winning team and the runner-up a small prize.
