OWASP security knowledge framework introduced a way of deploying interactive hacking labs easily from the UI!

Use the OWASP SKF to train yourself or your entire team to exploit and mitigate web application vulnerabilities.

From XSS to insecure object deserialization attacks, we have them all! For each lab we have, we also provide an extensive write-up that guides you trough the attacks step-by-step.

In our session:

- We will show you how the SKF is set-up, so you can get
started.
- Use SKF to generate security requirement to mitigate the
threats in the labs
- Implement mitigations in the labs code and verify them by
means of automated testing
