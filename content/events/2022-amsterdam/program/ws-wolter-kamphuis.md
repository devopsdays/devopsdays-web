Wondering what it takes to manage remote clusters reliable? We got you covered! Join us in this workshop where you can get your geek on and deploy and manage multiple clusters using Git, ArgoCD and Loki. We will be simulating a world where your cluster does not always have an internet connection. Still, you want to manage your clusters in a reliable way. In this workshop we will deploy a possible solution together.

You don't need to be a Kubernetes expert to attend this workshop, but you do need to have a basic understanding the Linux terminal. You will need a laptop to perform a series of assignments. We will provide you with a cluster to work on.
