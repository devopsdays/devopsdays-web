Working in a Fashion-Tech organization at PVH Europe, I am passionate about bringing collaboration and a growth mindset to organizations by empowering teams to find pragmatic ways of working together to deliver value to the market connected with a meaningful purpose that matters. I design and embed coaching programs and learning experiences to support others in their journey of continuous improvement and enhance a culture of a growth mindset. I am inspired by the Children's beginner's mindset and my work as a cellist player in a symphony orchestra to build devops/agile organizations. I am also a Ted & Paechakucha speaker on topics about curiosity and new ways of learnigs.
