Henk van der Schuur is a leader in software product development. Currently, he delivers mission-critical (software) solutions at Schuberg Philis, a company with no managers and dedicated teams with experts in the lead.

Henk is passionate about topics such as software product management, agile software production, (Biz)DevOps, and the associated technical, organizational, and cultural changes.

Although a nerd at heart, he also has years of experience in product management (AFAS Software) and comparable managerial rolesâ€”a huge benefit to bridge the gap between business and IT.
