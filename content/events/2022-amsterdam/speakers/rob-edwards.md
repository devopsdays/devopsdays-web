Rob Edwards is the DevOps Technology Practice Lead for Google Cloud UK, specialising in application/software delivery and operations. He has vast experience, wearing many hats (for example operations, software delivery, architecture, networking, developer experience, application modernisation, team transformation and the odd baseball cap), across startups to huge multinational organisations. With a coffee often in hand he loves chatting with practitioners and sharing stories about his passions in technology and the human aspects of technology adoption.
