Simon is best known for being the lead of the Selenium project for well over a decade. He is less well known for having worked on Buck, an Open Source build tool, and he can now be found as an active member of the Bazel community.

Somewhat unusually, he has a genuine interest in build systems, and thinking about how these can be applied to help people build better software, faster, and more safely.
