Software engineers like to create their own thing, they like to use open source tools to build an idea as a "side project". 

Maybe it’s a game you make for yourself and your friends but it’s not private so others can play the game too. Under these conditions it’s easy to think "I don’t need too much security for this little thing" but what if doing things the right way was the easy way and we just didn’t know? 

We can take advantage of free and low cost Software-as-a-Service solutions to make it so that our side project is just as secure as a production application at a Fortune 500 company.
