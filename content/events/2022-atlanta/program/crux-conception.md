When we hear the word “Ransomware,” it is so hard to believe that before a cyberattack is initiated and hackers/cyberthieves penetrate through your online security system…that someone on the inside offered valuable information to the hackers, giving them the ability to hold your company for RANSOM?

Are we that naive to think that an individual or organization, worlds away, actually know how much a company is willing to pay? Are we that unaware to think that someone on the inside supported the hackers/cyberthieves with valuable information regarding your company’s security system and protocols?

Why is it so hard to imagine that someone inside has specific information about how much a company is willing to pay and how much its product is considered a valuable resource to its vast customer base?

For example, what if AT&T had a disgruntled employee (with pertinent knowledge regarding AT&T’s security system and protocol). To a SOCIAL ENGINEER, this is the perfect candidate to recruit, gather valuable data, and then relay that information to a team of hackers/cyberthieves.

Furthermore, this presentation/workshop will demonstrate that with the proper preparation, one can evaluate an individual whose psychological profile dictates that they retain the potential to perform corporate espionage, steal data, disseminate false information & fake social media accounts.
