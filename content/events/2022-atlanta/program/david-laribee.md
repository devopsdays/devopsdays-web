Title = "Refactoring with Observability: Novel Practices For Learning"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["david-laribee"]
+++

In this example-heavy session, David will share two techniques the Nerd/Noir team invented within its dojo immersive learning environments to increase the design-time observability of complex software systems: refactoring with telemetry and architecture mapping.

Refactoring with telemetry establishes a tight feedback loop between and sometimes esoteric code quality metrics. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use learning tool that clarifies the close relationship between continuous refactoring and long-term sustainability.

They use the C4 Model of software architecture to map architectures and previsualize changes. A subset of UML, C4 turns diagrams into useful maps for different audiences and contexts. David will share how to engage teams in the mapping process and to use the maps to align technical debt repayment with value delivery, invite multiple perspectives, and engender shared mental models. Think of it as story mapping for systems.
