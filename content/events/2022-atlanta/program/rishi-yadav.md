With the number of services proliferating, developers are now working on a smaller and smaller subset of them. This has made effective testing of service changes and pull requests (PR) with dependencies a monumental task. Current processes require developers to wait in a queue before their PR can be tested or is accessible to a QA/staging environment for testing and certification. This process slows down PRs from merging into the main branch thus delaying releases. And, to make matters worse, if the pull request fails in testing the whole cycle starts again — consuming resources and time while increasing change failure rates. In order to maximize the synchronicity and productivity gain of a pull request every artifact in the DevOps pipeline needs to become ephemeral. Ephemeral environments are a modern tool that help to speed up by the software development lifecycle by allowing developers to:

- Create ephemeral environments on demand – local desktop or remote
- Launch or connect to any environment – local desktop or in existing CI/CD pipelines
- Simultaneously share workloads with other developers (in real time/P2P) and other stakeholders
- Schedule environment deployment time – prevent environments running 24/7
- Automatically test and certify of applications

It is time to rethink the SDLC process. Attend this session to discover how Environments as a Service (EaaS) platforms are revolutionizing DevOps processes by narrowing the gap between development and production.
