In thinking about big issues we face in DevOps, too much focus is on Tech and not enough on Business. We see DevOps as continuous flow.

Looking where "monitor" meets "plan",  Rob finds he's always been a fan of tracking and watching customer system activity. Think about how important the "2nd Use" of a feature is helps us validate when we're building, deploying, and supporting something truly needed.

Customer activity tracking while the product is immature is key. Assuring adoption of our new features validates future investment (and laps) around the figure eight DevOps “Racetrack”!
