Cassie Parlotto has been a Senior Product Manager in Atlanta for ten years. She's worked at some big companies, like The Home Depot and Oracle, but also a couple smaller shops including her current Echo360, a leading lecture capture provider for colleges & universities. She loves Product Management and loves that it has been a great complementary discipline to her other passion: personal self-development. The process for building out great products is delightfully similar to processes you can use to build out a happy & fulfilling life. Her current favorite framework is Design Thinking, which she is presenting in her Ignite talk.
