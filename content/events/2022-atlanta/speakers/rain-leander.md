Rain Leander is a systematic, slightly psychic, interdisciplinary developer evangelist with a Bachelor’s in dance and a Master’s in IT. An epic public speaker, they have disappeared within a box stuffed with swords, created life, and went skydiving with the Queen. Seriously. Rain is an active technical contributor with CockroachDB, OpenStack TripleO, Fedora, DjangoGirls, and Project DO. Come say hello. Bring cake.
