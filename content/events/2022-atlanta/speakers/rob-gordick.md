Rob Gordick is an Agile Transformation Leader and Speaker with Brown & Brown Insurance, an S&P 500 company, providing risk management solutions to help protect what our customers value most. Past companies and accounts include PwC, Goldman Sachs, The Home Depot, Allstate Ins. and Electronic Arts.

Passions include creating “Learning Cultures”, growing product teams, improving delivery quality, all while keeping the End-Customer always in mind.

As a Change Agent, I help people identify key roadblocks to change, radically improve their productivity and magnify innovation delivered.

As a Coach, I enable teams to develop a safe, questioning, and learning culture; passionate about delivering Customer value.

As an Lean DevSecOps Guide, I bring together Program & Portfolio team members, Delivery Leads and agile coaches with various agile approaches (e.g., XSCALE, SAFe, Kanban, XP, Scrum) to deepen effectiveness.

At the end of the day, I don't have all the answers but,
I like to create hypotheses with my team and test together!
