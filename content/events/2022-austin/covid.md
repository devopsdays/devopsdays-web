### FAQ

##### Where do masks need to be worn? 

Indoors. Masks are optional outdoors and may be removed while eating.

##### Will speakers have to wear masks during their talk?

No, it is optional for the active speaker.

##### How will you be verifying tests and vaccines? Is a certain kind of test or vaccine OK?

We will not be verifying testing or vaccines on site, you are on your honor per our Code of Conduct. Home tests are fine.

##### Will volunteers be having to enforce vaccinations and masking?

As a volunteer, you will not have to ask about vaccinations or testing; we will remind people at checkin of the requirement but are not verifying it. If someone isn't wearing a mask either upon entry or later during the conference, please remind them and offer one of our free masks we'll have on hand. If they refuse or are argumentative just go find an organizer, we will involve the venue and have them ejected, ain't nobody got time for that.
