### Get Your Tickets!

The format for DevOpsDays Austin this year will be smaller and more intimate than previous years, and focused on interaction and reflection.

Instead of the usual talks, we will be having speakers, many of them previous speakers and attendees, give short 20-minute talks on what they've learned over the last decade of DevOps. We will do openspaces in the afternoon, with a special focus on sharing each others' journeys and discussing what DevOps will look like in the next ten years.
