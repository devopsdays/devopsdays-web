We all have unconscious biases. We need to fight these biases to create a welcoming and inclusive work environment for everyone.

At the heart of DevOps lies a fundamentally inclusive mindset: We break down silos in organizations, we get people to communicate across teams and we share knowledge and experience across the borders of organizations and countries. However, it is still a fact that in the tech industry in general, we lack diversity: Women are still underrepresented. What are reasons for this? Why should we try to change this? And how can we as individuals contribute to this change?
