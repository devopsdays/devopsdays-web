In a lot of the meetings I've attended, a few voices have been heard over all the others. It can often be a text book example of the 80/20 rule, and now that a lot more meetings are remote it has made this gap all the more obvious.

There are usually a few things at play; power dynamics, confidence (or privilege) and engagement are all factors. But how can we make space for voices that might be overlooked to be recognised? And how can you comfortably make sure your thoughts are heard in situation where the discourse is ploughing forward like a steam train?

In this talk I'll talk through the things you can do, whether you are running or participating in a meeting, to balance things out and make space for more perspectives and ideas.
