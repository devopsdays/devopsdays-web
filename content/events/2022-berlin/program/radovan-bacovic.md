Happy to tell the GitLab story of how we embrace DevOps and Open Source in the (officially) biggest all-remote company in the world to do the magical things and move fast in the Data World.

Thrilled to share our experience from the Data Team with the broader audience about how to move fast, stay focused on the success journey and orchestrate team members around the globe.

Also, will share the secret sauce on how to start fully transparent and keep the startup vibrance in the fast growing company.
