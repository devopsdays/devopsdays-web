A key concern of delivery teams is turning ideas into features in the hands of users at pace.
This means having the right tools and processes in form of a delivery pipeline  in place.

With the advent of the DevOps movement we have seen an immense improvement in software delivery by closely linking software engineering with deployment and infrastructure and consequently improving  our delivery pipelines, i.e. the tools and processes that enable us to turn ideas into features in the hands of users.

We have also seen an increase in complexity of options: what is needed for one organisation is not what another organisation requires or can even stomach.

In fact, our experience from numerous DevOps transformation projects shows that we need to consider aspects of DevOps as strategic organisational assets, and in turn, must treat them as we would a product.

By adding Product Thinking to DevOps we add the final missing piece to ensure that we meet not only technical needs but wider business expectations.

In this talk we will demonstrate that there is value in shifting our perception of our delivery pipeline from technical capability to ‘product’, how this leads to not only better ways of working but also better overall outcomes, and how product management can easily be added to DevOps in practice.

The talk draws on a wide range fo real world examples with organisations across startup and bluechip space and illustrates how these organisations added product thinking to the design and implementation of their delivery pipeline and what value this provided to the organisation - in one example simply being faster than competitors, in another example saving 90+ man days per quarterly release, just to mention a few….
