Recruitment is not an easy task; in 2018, I founded the German branch of Polar Squad, a Finnish consulting agency specializing in DevOps. It's now 2022, and we are around ten people, most of whom are DevOps experts. During that period, we had a good amount of success and failures.
I want to share my experience going through the different aspects of the recruitment process we created to find the right people for our organization.
