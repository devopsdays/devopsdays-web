With 10 years of experience in the area of software development, software
testing, software architecture, and DevOps the speaker is a versatile Research
Software Engineer (RSE) with a strong preference for DevOps technologies and
practices. Products that he developed were web applications such as seminar,
course, learning and campus management systems. During the last couple of years
DevOps moved more and more into the focus of his work. As an RSE and
DevOps-Engineer at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR, hzdr.de) he
and his colleagues were recently working on a GitLab service (called "the
Helmholtz Codebase") - a free self-hosted version of the popular software
project management and DevOps platform - that everyone in the Helmholtz
Association can use free of charge. The Helmholtz Codebase is offered as part
of the Helmholtz Cloud (https://helmholtz.cloud) and made available by the
Helmholtz Federated IT Services (HIFIS, hifis.net) platform.
