Byron (he/they pronouns) is a lifelong devotee of computers who teethed on C++ but now works mostly in Java, Maven, Python, and the wonderful world of Kubernetes. He is staunchly pro-workerâ€™s rights. DevOps by day, dad by night, millennial by accident of birth. Offline Byron can be found enjoying the lifestyle of a 99th-percentile extrovert, playing basketball, analyzing both kinds of football, practicing the piano and pipe organ, and listening to a strange combination of electronic body music and They Might Be Giants.
