JR (short for Jean-Rémi) is the CTO of Theodo in New York, a software consultancy. He moved to the US in 2018 after living in London for 2 years but is originally from France which explains his passion for cooking. When he isn’t setting up software architectures or creating interfaces for his clients, he enjoys exploring the US with his wife Sara.
