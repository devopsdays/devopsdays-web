My name is Karthik Ashokan. I have been at Fetch Rewards for about 2.5 years. I have experience in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), CI/CD, and observability/monitoring.

I love automation. I am constantly looking for ways to automate, whether it is deployments, testing, or updating a Slack topic with the current on-call person. Infrastructure-as-code excites me, especially when building on top of it to simplify further (mainly for developers that are less concerned with the infra). Coupling IaC with CI/CD makes me smile, a utopian smile. Commit code and kick off a pipeline that: builds infra, deploys code, runs units tests and integration tests, code coverage, etc, and notifies of the deployment. If all goes well, just swap the URLs (blue/green deploys).

I have an electrical engineering background so I do tinker with some hardware along with software. I built a sit-to-stand desk with linear actuators and an Arduino controller with a remote control to adjust the height, because why not?

I love animals. We have two dogs and are usually foster a third. I actually joined Fetch because they allow dogs in the office and the logo is a dog.
