Global Dynamics 365 CRM rollouts can be very complicated. Even more than an Adele love song. On top of the complexity in product development and making it fit for purpose across a myriad of business entities, managing users resistant to change and new ways of working can be a minefield.

There does not seem to be enough open conversations about how to manage this magnitude of change from the start. Change Management is still considered as a latter part of the delivery plan. But with that, there also seems to be a compromise in a human-centered design thinking as technical experts can struggle championing the user lens. So how can we learn together and do better?

In this session, I will share with you lessons I learned as a Change Manager from a Dynamics 365 rollout in over 50 countries with more than 11000 users. From giving custom fields out like candy, to managing user CRUD permissions like Braveheart, and explaining to users non-logged sales donâ€™t count, I am here to talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.
