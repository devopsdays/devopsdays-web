A year and a half ago, I was a brand new junior engineer - and had just landed my first ever role in tech!

Since then, I’ve had the chance to get to grips with infrastructure at two different companies, and reflect on what helped my development the most. This talk is a first hand account of what was most effective- with a bit of learning theory thrown into the mix!
Things I’ll talk about:
Effective feedback
(Technical) challenge and growth
Empathy is underrated
