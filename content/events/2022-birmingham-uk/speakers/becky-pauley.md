Working as a primary school teacher, I started learning Python in my spare time- and got hooked on the feeling of solving problems. A year and a half ago, I finally made the leap from teaching into tech! I’ve since worked as a Platform Engineer and joined Jetstack at the start of this year to focus on Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies. As well as all things infrastructure, I’m passionate about ways of working, learning and culture.
