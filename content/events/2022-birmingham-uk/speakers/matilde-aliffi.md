I am a philosopher turned Software Engineer. During the final year of my PhD I realised that philosophy and software are not as different as they seem. I discovered a passion for programming and after finishing my doctorate I joined The Economist (Birmingham, UK) as a Software Engineer. I also started to collaborate with SikhNet in 2021, working mainly on back-end development. I love cloud infrastructure, programming, and the buzz of the Birmingham tech community. I am passionate about teaching and volunteer as a lead instructor for CodeFirst: Girls, a social enterprise that pledged to teach women to code to challenge the gender imbalance in the tech industry. I am also a School of Code mentor and I collaborate with the University of Birmingham as a career mentor.
