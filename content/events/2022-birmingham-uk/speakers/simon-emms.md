Simon has been working as a software engineer since 2006, in which time he's done work for the likes of Gitpod, DPD, Specsavers, British Path√©, the NHS, the Red Cross and others. He's used pretty much all of the major languages over the years and since 2017 has been focused on building DevOps solutions and Cloud-native applications that help engineers to work faster and more productively. Since 2021, he has been working with Gitpod to improve the self-hosted experience, which is relied upon by companies with specific security and compliance requirements.
When not behind a computer he's a keen gardener, beekeeper and makes his own sausages.
