In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, DevOpsDays Boston is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2022 event:

We are requiring vaccination for in-person attendance. If you are not able to show proof of vaccination, you are invited to participate online. Specifically, all in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) must have completed a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two weeks prior to this event, by August 29, 2022. We will require proof of vaccination – acceptable proof must show that you have received at least two doses of a two-dose vaccine, or at least one dose of a one-dose vaccine, at least fourteen days ago, and bear the same name as on your valid state, federal, or passport ID. A negative COVID test will not be accepted as a substitute for proof of vaccination.

We welcome travelers from outside of the US, but do not necessarily have expertise in validating non-CDC-issued vaccine cards. Please reach out to us at [boston@devopsdays.org](mailto:boston@devopsdays.org) ahead of the conference, so that we can ensure that we’re prepared to validate your vaccine card.

While local mask mandates have been lifted, at this time well-fitted masks will still be required to be worn at our event; ‘makeshift’ masks (such as neck gaiters or bandanas) or masks with exhalation vents will not be accepted. Masks will be available on-site for anyone who requires one.

If you are feeling sick on either day of the event, we strongly encourage you to stay home and not try to attend.

If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by August 29, 2022 if applicable and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
