## <a name="seneca-one"></a>Seneca One Tower:

After two years of pandemic conference planning, we are looking forward to returning to a more traditional event. To kick things off right, we wanted to select a venue that focused around tech and innovation, as well as highlight some of the exciting investment and development happenings across the Buffalo region. We wanted to find an option that felt closer to the action and that could help showcase the region’s rebirth.

Built between 1969 and 1974, Seneca One tower in downtown Buffalo is one of the most iconic buildings in the city skyline. Formerly known as the Marine Midland Center, and later One HSBC Center, Seneca One is the tallest building in Buffalo at 40-floors and 529 Feet in height offering uninterrupted 360-degree skyline views of downtown Buffalo. Recently redeveloped by Douglas Development as a multi-use property that includes dining, professional, and residential spaces, Seneca One has become a destination for entrepreneurs, innovation, and technology in the heart of downtown Buffalo. Seneca One is conveniently located in proximity to a large selection of dining options, recreational activities offered by the Buffalo waterfront, lodging, sporting venues, and purveyors of libation.

The auditorium at Seneca One can support up to 250 individuals and is wheelchair accessible (including restrooms, gallery spaces, and dining). Service animals are welcome in the facility and live captioning will be available during the conference presentations.

## <a name="hotels">Hotels:
The Transit Drive-in is located in a rural community a few miles North and East of Buffalo. There is minimal travel pressure across the region during early October, so blocks of rooms at a specific hotel have not been prepared in advance. For locations near the venue, we would suggest:

### Hampton Inn Lockport - Buffalo
6082 S Transit Rd  
Lockport, NY 14094  

### Holiday Inn Express
6900 S Transit Rd
