Continuous integration is the gold standard in software development. It acts as a safety net for software developers introducing changes to the systems they are responsible for. As with any standard, there is a wealth of information, tooling, and architectures to choose from. But which one is right for you and your company? This talk will cover how to design scalable CI pipelines including which metrics to track to ensure developers stay happy and productive. Weâ€™ll follow the journey of introducing Continuous Integration to a company of 4 engineers, and scaling it to support a team of 20 engineers that deploy at least 10 times per day.
