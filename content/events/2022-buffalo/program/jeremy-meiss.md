How really important are mentorship and documentation to the survival of civilization? What would happen if we lost everything and had to start over, say, due to a global pandemic? In this talk, we'll explore my fascination with dystopian TV shows and seek to answer these questions, and come to some action steps to do our part through mentorship, documentation, and more.
