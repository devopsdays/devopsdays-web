Spending 6+ years building and operating production platform
infrastructure on top of Kubernetes has left many scars in my
engineering tenure. In this session we begin to unpack what I consider
to be the main operational risks of today, while exploring which
systems we can influence to start pointing the industry towards a
better tomorrow.

What are the main operational problems with modern platform
infrastructure today? Which systems can we change to begin to
influence to shift the industry? How do we maintain backwards
compatibility while also getting systems like Kubernetes off to
future-forward state?
