Many folks have an image of Open Source. To some it’s “if I build it, they will come”. Others, “it’s unregulated, Wild West - not dependable”. And even others, “it’s how we do business”
In this talk, we’ll discuss Open Source as it stands today, the best way to use Open Source, and how to be a participant and good Open Source citizen.
