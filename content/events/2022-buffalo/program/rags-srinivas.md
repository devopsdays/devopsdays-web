It is no secret that Kubernetes, in particular app dev, is extremely complex, cumbersome and intimidating even for those who work with it on a daily basis. Now, imagine being a developer who is new to Kubernetes and needs to push their applications to a Kubernetes service. Unless devs start embracing tool chains/platforms (not involving a paradigm shift) that make it easier, the inner loop will seem complex and a tough nut to crack.

In this session based loosely around https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-intro-quarkus-cassandra, we will build a functional ToDo app with an opinionated inner loop using open source tools such as Jib, gitpod, Quarkus, Lens, etc. that involves only making slight adjustments to existing tool chains that developers are already comfortable with. These tools offer a great developer experience especially on Kubernetes.

The session will start from scratch by installing the prerequisites and will learn how to hook up the Quarkus app to AstraDB, containerize it and end up packaging it as a native app, all from gitpod - a cloud-based IDE and deploying it with Lens. You will also look at the inner loop features such as hot reloading, debugging, etc., which make development a joy again!

After attending this session/workshop you will better understand the challenges of inner loop development on Kubernetes and how to mitigate them without making a complete paradigm shift.

Youâ€™ll Learn:

How to work with Kubernetes as an app developer
Creating a simplified inner loop that you can adopt for daily use
Most importantly, no need to master kubectl :-)
