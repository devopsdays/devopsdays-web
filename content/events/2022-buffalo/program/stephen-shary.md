At times, it feels like everyone qualifies to be a Sr. Engineer. After a year of experience, many companies can't really distinguish between engineering levels. It can be difficult for engineers to understand how to grow in a technical career. Years of experience are the only real factor. In this talk, we present technical paths beyond a senior engineering level. We present companies that promote different growth tracks along with engineers that distinguish themselves. This will provide actionable opportunities along with ideas on how to identify when your current role won't grow and how to respond.
