**Sr. Solutions Architect @ Cloudify**

Anthony Critelli currently works as a Sr. Solutions Architect at Cloudify and an Adjunct Instructor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His background is in Linux systems engineering, with a focus on automation using Puppet, Terraform, Ansible, and Vault. Much of his experience is in on-premesis VM-based environments (Openstack and VMware), but he's also done quite a bit of work with AWS and Kubernetes. He started his career as a network engineer focused on traditional routing and switching before becoming deeply interested in the Linux systems world. In his free time, he is a core ("Sudoer") contributor to the RedHat Enable SysAdmin blog. Outside of tech, he is a Rochestarian who enjoys everything that Western NY has to offer.
