**Technology Manager at M&T Bank**

Daniel Pries is a polyglot engineer with an absolute love for the science of telling electrons how to behave across a metal substrate, so that it brings people together. Whether its creating experiences for customers, solving unique technology problems, or coaching engineers to be the best versions of themselves.

For 8 hours a day, I have the unique privilege of guiding a few technology teams at M&T Bank. I spend the other 16 hours on many amazing adventures and side quests with my wife and our five amazing children.
