**CTO at ScoutAPM**

In over 20 years in IT and Tech, I have served as a Systems/Network/Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, Software Developer, Site Reliability Engineer, and CTO. With a broad technical background across infrastructure design, operation, and software development, I am passionate about designing and building observability products that provide answers to the complex problems facing modern Software and DevOps Engineering teams. Current interests focus on emerging technologies, including languages and runtimes like Rust and WebAssembly, Cloud r/evolution, and how to best enable observability among new and existing technologies through OpenTelemetry.
