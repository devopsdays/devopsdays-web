**Head of Product - ScoutAPM**

Scott has held senior technical and leadership roles at numerous startups over the last fifteen years for both application and data engineering organizations. He got his start in the gaming and VFX industry. After that he co-founded an early cloud tooling startup that participated in Mozilla's Web FWD accelerator. Later when the data science and engineering space took off, his PhD in computational physics led him down the ML/AI path where he led technical data teams for a number of startups. There were also a few years in between doing computational paleontology for the Swiss government along the way. Most recently Scott has been helping to lead product and engineering efforts at Scout on the road from APM monitoring to next-generation observability.
