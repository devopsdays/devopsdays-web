<h2>DevOps Days Buffalo is back for our fourth year!</h2>
<p>In year one we were in a beautiful castle, and then - during the pandemic
- we shifted to online in order to continue bringing speakers and participants together despite all odds. In year three we
tried a hybrid approach, streaming online and also having an in-person component at a drive-in. It's been a wild ride!
For year four, we're attempting to have a return to a more in-person focused event, hosting at Seneca One. Seneca One is
one of the tech hubs in the city of Buffalo itself, making it very convenient for many local tech workers.</p>

<h2>About the Event</h2>
<p>DevOps Days Buffalo, or DODBUF, is a ~150 attendee, non-profit, community-driven event that aims to assemble
local tech practitioners in order to bring the global DevOps Days mission to this city. This conference will gather
the highest quality professionals in the Buffalo tech community to discuss topics and exchange ideas regarding software
development and IT operations (and everything in between). Throughout this time, attendees will have the opportunity
to listen to a series of curated talks and ignites regarding automation, testing, security, organizational culture,
and more. Additionally, they will be able to take part in group-organized “open spaces” that will allow them to discuss
any topic selected by the group as a collective.</p>

<h2>Let's Talk About COVID-19</h2>
<p>Due to anticipated changes to the COVID-19 guidelines, we will be requiring attendees to wear masks and maintain social distancing during the event.</p>
