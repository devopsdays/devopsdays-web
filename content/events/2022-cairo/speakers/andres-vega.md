I’m a maintainer, contributor, author, product leader, and open source troublemaker. 

Throughout my career, my focus has been on the intersection of cloud infrastructure, security, and software delivery with open source projects like the Linux Kernel, Linux Containers, container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, and cryptographically-verifiable identities with SPIFFE.

As a product manager, I’m passionate about bringing innovative ideas to fruition. My specialty is in driving positive organizational change and facilitating engineering outcomes at all stages of the product development lifecycle.

I participate actively in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a recognized Technical Oversight Committee Contributor and as Technical Leader in the Security Technical Advisory Group (TAG Security).
