I am Nourhan, a Senior DevOps Engineer in DXC Technology with 5-years of experience working with different AWS partners in different regions. 

I was able to gain 5 AWS certifications in one year and half. I am keen to learn and read about the new technologies.

I love traveling! I traveled to USA attending AWS reinvent in Las Vegas, also traveled to UAE. I hope this year or next I will have a tour in Europe!
