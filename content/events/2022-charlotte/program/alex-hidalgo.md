You need to measure your computer services to know how they’re operating. Logs, metrics, traces, SLOs, statistical analysis, probabilistic normalization – within tech our approaches to understanding how things are going are more complex than ever. But it’s not just software and hardware that needs to be monitored. Just about every discipline on the planet has some concept of how to monitor, measure, and account for detected failures. In this talk we’ll discuss some ways other disciplines such as the transit industry measure their own output, what the difference is between measurement and monitoring, and what we can learn from that when measuring our own.
