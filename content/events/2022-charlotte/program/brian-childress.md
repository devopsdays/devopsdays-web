Are you blocked by manual processes, inefficiencies, and knowledge silos? Are developers happy or frustrated? Join me and we’ll explore some of the ways you can enable developers to do their best work and improve the developer experience through a focus on tools, processes, and collaboration.

With the increased cloud adoption, smaller autonomous development teams, and microservices we need a way to ensure consistency and productivity. In this talk we’ll explore topics like: boilerplate templates, development environments, CI/CD, code reviews, and effective documentation.

If you’re a developer trying to improve your work day-to-day or an engineering leader trying to empower your teams, this talk has something for you.
