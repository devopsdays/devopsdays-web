DevOps professionals need to know more than ever before. Furthermore, the range of products and disciplines we need to know is incredibly wide and changing constantly. As somebody who learns for a living (and takes time out to sell what I’ve learned to clients along the way), I’ve adopted a number of tactics that I use. I believe you can use these tactics too.
