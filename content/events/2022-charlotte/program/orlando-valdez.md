Progressive Delivery is the process of releasing service updates in a controlled and gradual manner, coupled with automation and metrics analysis to drive the promotion or rollback of the update.

In this session, we’ll take a brief look at different deployment strategies using Kubernetes. Following that, we’ll demonstrate how to implement progressive delivery for service updates using the canary strategy with the help of the Argo Rollouts controller.
