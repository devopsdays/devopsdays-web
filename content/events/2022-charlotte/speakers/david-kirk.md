"I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Durham in the UK. I enjoy long walks on the beach supplemented by large quantities of sunscreen, not living in the basement of my mom’s house, and I recently built a pretty sweet tree fort. I spent a good part of the past few years as a Senior DevOps Engineer at ReviewTrackers, the better part leading the push to overhaul our DevOps at NTWRK, and the best part as my mother’s son. I am closing in on the eight year anniversary of moving out of my mom’s house, and hope to one day be taken seriously by my 7th grade PE teacher.

Since entering the industry, most of my work has been focused on improving development workflows, and generally trying to make the jobs of my coworkers easier!"
