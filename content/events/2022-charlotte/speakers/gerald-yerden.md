I’ve been in industry for nearly a decade working to get software deployed locally in the Charlotte area. I have worked as a Software Engineer, Cloud Architect, and Solutions Engineer across a variety of projects. Everything from mobile/web apps to IoT, with the latter part of my career focused on writing code that solves infrastructure problems in the cloud and on-prem because as a software engineer that was the major bottleneck for me getting my apps in front of customers. I’ve been at Hashicorp for the last 2.5 years helping customers solve these problems and in my new role as a DA I get to focus on enabling engineers even more which I’m excited about. :)
