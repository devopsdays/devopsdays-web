Trip is a rainbow-haired, queer devops nerd, that doesn’t believe work has to be as boring and painful as it currently is. They are a developer advocate at Garden.io and help facilitate the Portland DevOpsDays conference. When Trip isn’t in front of their computer, they like to sing karaoke, go trail running, and practice on the trapeze. They have 2 cats, Dexter and Diego, who have taught them more about boundaries than any human they’ve met.
