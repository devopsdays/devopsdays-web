In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, DevOpsDays Chicago is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2022 event:

* We are requiring vaccination for in-person attendance. If you are not able to show proof of vaccination, you are invited to participate online. Specifically, all in-person participants - including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees - must have completed a full COVID-19 vaccination (full defined as both shots of Pfizer/Moderna or one shot of Johnson & Johnson) at least two (2) weeks prior to this event, by September 7, 2022. We will require proof of vaccination -- original card, legible photo of card (front and back), or app -- plus matching ID for badge pickup. A negative COVID test will not be accepted as a substitute for proof of vaccination. We welcome travelers from outside of the US, but do not necessarily have expertise in validating non-CDC-issued vaccine cards. Please reach out to us at chicago@devopsdays.org ahead of the conference, so that we can ensure that weâ€™re prepared to validate your vaccine card.

* While local mask mandates have been lifted, at this time well-fitted masks (i.e. KN95/N95/KF94) will still be required to be worn at our event; 'makeshift' masks (such as neck gaiters or bandanas) or masks with exhalation vents will not be accepted. We are paying close attention to the [Illinois Department of Health](https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/community-guidance.html) recommendations and the [City of Chicago Community Transmission and Risk](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/community-transmission-and-risk.html) pages for further guidance. Masks will be available on-site for anyone who requires one.

* If you are feeling sick on either day of the event, we strongly encourage you to stay home and not try to attend. Refunds are available for any ticketholder who cannot attend due to illness.

* If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by emailing chicago@devopsdays.org and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
