We recommend the use of the [Trip Planner on the CTA website](https://www.transitchicago.com/).

## From the Airports

From the O’Hare airport, it’s about a 50-minute CTA Blue line train ride toward Forest Park to the UIC-Halsted stop. From there, take the #8 bus to Roosevelt and Halsted, or just walk south on Halsted to the venue at Halsted and Roosevelt (approx 15 minute walk).

From the Midway airport, it is about a 20-minute CTA Orange line ride toward downtown Chicago to the Roosevelt stop. Walk west to State and Roosevelt and take the #18 bus west to Roosevelt and Halsted.

## Via Trains

The conference location is accessible via CTA trains. The nearest “el” train stop is the UIC-Halsted stop for the Blue line (15 minute walk), or the Roosevelt stop on Red/Orange, which is a short ride on the #18 bus to Halsted and Roosevelt. If you are coming in on Metra, we recommend taking a Lyft (a code will be emailed to registered attendees) from either Union Station or Ogilvie.

## Driving and Parking

The UIC Forum is centrally located within the Chicagoland area, but please check your favorite app for day-of traffic conditions as nearby highway construction has made of mess of things. There is no free parking. Ample parking is available 2 blocks west of the Forum at [UIC Parking Lot 5](https://goo.gl/maps/nCSJbo8ifbm1MTE3A) at 1135 South Morgan Street, for $13 for 24 hours. The lot does not open until 8. See also https://spothero.com/chicago/uic-forum-parking for other options.
