Vulnerability exploits too often seem like empty threats that our security teams warn us about but not something that would ever happen to my code!
Join me in this hands-on workshop where we will walk through a remote code execution exploit and then talk about the steps you can employ that would mitigate the attack.

If you want to participate in the hands-on hacking, a container runtime environment pre-installed on your laptop is encouraged. (i.e. Docker Desktop)
