I made my way through engineering for most of my career before pivoting into DevRel for a few years and now I'm back in engineering again. I have a lot of thoughts for what I've learned from my experience that I'd like to share to help others in these industries. Specifically I'll walk through:

* Context setting by discussing my engineering career
* Why I pivoted into DevRel
* Why I pivoted back into engineering
* General thoughts on DevRel and engineering careers
* Advice on navigating the tech industry.
