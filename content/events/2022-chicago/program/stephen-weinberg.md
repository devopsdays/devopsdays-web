Individual teams are making strides to have a better approach to software development that is in line with DevOps philosophy. But at a larger scale there are still many teams stuck under a backlog of work or in front of a fire hose of new expectations. One of the solutions we found is to mobilize the QA Engineers to help expand the capacity for cultural and process change.

In this talk I will focus on:

-	Our DevOps organizational pattern
-	Where is it working
-	Where it isn’t working
-	A false dichotomy between QA and DevOps
-	The cultural shift in QA thinking
    -  Postmortems
    - Not about testing about a process that results in quality
    - Producing faster feedback loops
-	The technical shift in QA work
    - Clean code principles in tests
         Simple and focused as possible: API tests, Data Comparisons
	Minimize use of scripted workflows
    - Environmentally defined smoke tests
	Focus on reliable tests
	Clear prioritization
	Able to run fast
-	The results
    - Devs more interested in tests
    - Devs doing more to maintain tests
    - Quicker feedback to devs since it can be run on PR
