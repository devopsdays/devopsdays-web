My career is an example of the indirect route. I graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in East Asian Studies, taught English in Taiwan, worked as an Analyst, Project Manager and DBA at a start-up and a non-profit before joining Morningstar in 2011. While at Morningstar, I worked to build out development teams and figure out how to measure performance, risk and reliability in meaningful ways. I am currently the Director of SRE. Outside of work you can find me  practicing my banjo, banging on metal or just walking my dog around the city.
