Please ensure all marketing materials and swag are appropriate and in line with our [Code of Conduct](http://devopsdays.org/events/2022-chicago/conduct/).

### Sponsor Pitch

Each Gold Sponsor will have one minute to address the main hall and the listening audience during scheduled blocks between talks. Please ensure that the content of your pitch adheres to the [Code of Conduct](http://devopsdays.org/events/2022-chicago/conduct/).

This is a simple verbal pitch. No slides, banners, or other materials. We will display your company logo on the main screen during your pitch. Most folks mention their job openings/company overview rather than a product pitch.  Here's an example from 2017 (start at 1hr11min) : <https://youtu.be/w1sZrtaSp4s?t=1h11m34s>

## Other FAQs

**How many people will be attending the conference?**

We are expecting 400-450 people at the conference. This year we are capping total attendance to allow for spacing out as needed.

**What are the demographics of the attendees?**

DevOpsDays conferences typically attract software, operations, infosec, QA, and build engineers, as well as architects and technology managers. From voluntary attendee data, 22% had VP or Director-level titles, 17% had senior level titles, and over 85% had technical roles.

These folks are attending to learn and to share learnings about the DevOps movement. They most appreciate sponsors who engage with them with that in mind.

**Will sponsors get an email list of attendees? Do we get a dedicated email blast?**

No, we will not be sending out a formalized list. 

Gold and Silver sponsors will have their logos in all conference emails to participants. We cannot send out emails on behalf of sponsors and will not share contact information or lists of attendee names.

**When can we pick our booth spot?**

Booths are assigned accordingly to sponsor level, then prioritized by when payment was received. We try not to place competitors next to each other and try to accommodate any requests.

**What is the booth set up? Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?**

Booths are long tables ( 72" x 30") with a black tablecloth and power strip. Silver sponsors share half the table and 1 chair. Gold sponsors get a full table and 2 chairs. We recommend bringing/shipping: signage, handouts, pop-up banners, giveaways, etc. Banners must fit behind your booth.

**How many scanners (and which type) do we get?**

This is not your typical conference. The booth is a place to interact with people during breaks. Sponsors​ ​benefit​​ ​most​ ​when​ ​they actively​ ​participate​.

You are responsible for collecting any information in person. Raffles with a business card draw work well. Just let us know and we will give time on Day 2 to announce raffle winners between talks and lunch. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference, attend talks, and actively participate in open space sessions with the other attendees.

**What is the 20% off code for additional sponsorship tickets?**

`SPONSOR-2022-0QDQ`

(Please note that that last portion has a zero in it, not an O.)

**Who should staff the booth? What are expo hours?**

If your goal is recruiting, consider sending engineering managers. If you are a vendor, send your sales engineers as well as your technical product marketing, and even some engineers. DevOpsDays are about quality, not quantity - it's about active participation!

**Can we do a giveaway on stage?**

Yes. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g. business cards, entry slips, etc.) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use. After the ignites on the second day, we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.

**Can I sponsor a talk?**

Absolutely not. Devopsdays does not sell conference speaking slots; sponsors' employees are welcome to submit talk proposals.

**Can I get a discount for sponsoring multiple DevOpsDays?**

All DevOpsDays events are independently organized, so no multi-city sponsorships are available.

**Who organizes DevOpsDays Chicago?**

Your [../contact/](DevOpsDays Chicago organizers) are Chicago-based technology folks who volunteer their time for this event.

All money collected from sponsors goes towards the conference and its related expenses. We are not a non-profit, so sponsorships are not tax deductible. Contact us at chicago-sponsors@devopsdays.org  to get our W9.

For any questions, email all of us at <chicago@devopsdays.org>
