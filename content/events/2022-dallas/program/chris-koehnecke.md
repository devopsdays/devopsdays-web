##### TALK ABSTRACT

In this talk we will focus on five critical security controls that will be integrated as part of the CI/CD pipeline by leveraging some excellent open source tools, including: Bandit or SEMGrep for static application security (SAST), Gitleaks to detect hard-coded or insufficiently secured secrets & dependency checks (SCA), KICS for infrastructure as code (IaC) and OWASPâ€™s ZAP for API and dynamic application security (DAST), in addition to custom controls to ensure proper enforcement of MFA via Github Security. These controls will provide a foundational framework for securing your applications from the first line of code, that will make it possible to continuously iterate and evolve your security maturity all the way through advanced layers of security that comes with time, as well as increased experience with your deployments, stacks, and security posture.

Code examples & demos will be showcased as part of this session.
