##### TALK ABSTRACT

Being a part of a fast-growing business is stressful, especially for engineers. I’d like to hear and share war stories about on-call days, discuss why we push for 100% reliability and where that concept comes from, how we address services that “can’t” go down like our banking, and the challenges we have all faced (or expect to face) when push to change the reliability conversation to something a bit more realistic, including but not limited to our development process, our views on success, and our customer’s expectations.
