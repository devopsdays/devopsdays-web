##### TALK ABSTRACT

We are in the middle of rebuilding everything all yet again, mostly thanks to kubernetes resetting the infrastructure layer. This means it’s time to build a new set of management tools and appdev stacks. After all, kubernetes is “a platform for building platforms,” so now we get to build the platforms. This is frustrating if you’ve lived through two decades (or more!) of platform building, but as this talk will cover, this never ending, platform recurrence of is the natural state and something we should embrace. What lessons can we bring forward to make it better this time?
