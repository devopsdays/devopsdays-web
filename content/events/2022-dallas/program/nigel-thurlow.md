##### TALK ABSTRACT

Join Nigel Thurlow, former Chief of Agile at Toyota as he explains how weâ€™ve been fooled into thinking a value stream is a digital concept. Hear from him as he explains how Agile is failing in organizations and how DevOps is not just confined to the technical domains; it is an enterprise wide concept that embraces all levels of complicate and governance, and to succeed we are going to need more than a few technical tools to automate the IT workflow.nThat push button deployment needs more than a Scrum team and a few CI/CD tools. Is your digital transformation truly digital or is it really analog masquerading as digital. Nigel will explore this and much more in his keynote talk at this years DevOpsDays.
