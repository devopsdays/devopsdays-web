##### TALK ABSTRACT

A powerful way to learn and get new perspectives is to look at other industries: We like to borrow ideas from manufacturing for Lean and Agile, Operations and infrastructure folks are borrowing from software code writing.

In this talk I would like to highlight ideas, concepts and technologies that circulate around the buzz of the Metaverse and relate them back to the world of Devops.

Ok, ok I hear you the buzzword factor is going through the roof here. Just as serverless is still running on a server, the Metaverse is still running on technology. I think some of those technologies are worthwhile to understand and valuable to see if they can be useful elsewhere.

I will touch on concepts such as Digital twins, Prompt engineering, Cyber Physical Systems, Live Ops, Level of Detail and Synthetic media to name a few.

Obviously, this is an exploratory session and does not have all the dots perfectly connected but I hope it will inspire, highlight and spark some new thinking.

No prior Metaverse knowledge or VR headset is required.
