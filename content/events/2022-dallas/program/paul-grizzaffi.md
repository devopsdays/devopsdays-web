##### TALK ABSTRACT

Most companies with a DevOps culture have a test automation endeavor; some are just starting, and some are humming right along. Typically, these endeavors focus on “traditional automation,” using a software package to automate existing test cases or tests for user stories. Not that there’s anything wrong with that; often, there is value in that method. If, however, we use only the traditional approach to automation, we miss opportunities to exploit the power of automation.

Instead of focusing on how many test cases we can automate, what if we consider this: how can automation help teams be more effective or more efficient at delivering appropriate software?

During this session, the author will share real-world examples where non-traditional test automation (or “automation assist”) provided business value, highlighting cases where the traditional method could not have provided the same level of value. You will also hear some considerations to keep in mind when implementing “automation assist” in a DevOps-focused team.
