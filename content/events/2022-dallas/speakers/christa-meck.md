I’ve been in the DevOps space for a long time. Once as an engineer, now as a Manager. Finding order in chaos is my super power.

When I’m not at work I am probably doing something outdoors for many many hours in a row. Running, cycling, swimming, orienteering, adventure racing, mountain biking, trail running, camping, hiking… you get the idea.
