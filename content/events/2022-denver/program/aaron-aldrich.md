Mental illness is stigmatized and hard to talk about publicly. Doubly so in the tech industry where we assign much of our personal value to our brains. I want to share my struggles with mental health and the lessons I’ve learned from Systems operation and DevOps that have helped me get by and frame my struggle in a manageable way.

In this talk I:

- Help reduce the stigma of Mental Illness by talking about it
- Provide some illustration of things that have helped me, so hopefully they can help you
- Show how the concepts of DevOps have application reaching beyond High Technology
- Spark further conversation about Mental health and DevOps
