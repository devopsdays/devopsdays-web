Incident Management is the process of effectively responding to outages and incidents in your service with minimal further disruption to the users of the service. As an avid reader and consumer of romantic stories and a former SRE in charge of responding to incidents, Ajuna will go over what they've learnt about how to handle (or not handle) incidents from reading romance novels. This talk will cover when to call an incident, how to communicate the status of the incident to interested parties, and lessons learned from non software scenarios to become a better incident responder.
