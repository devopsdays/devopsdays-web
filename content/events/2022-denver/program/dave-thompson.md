You've probably heard about GitOps, a way to manage deployment configuration as versioned code, but you maybe wondering how well it works in real life. In this talk we will discuss the real life reasons teams adopt GitOps to manage deployment configuration. I will share my experiences implementing GitOps in a large scale multi-datacenter and multi-cloud deployment environment. This talk will highlight both usecases where GitOps excels and usecases where GitOps is problematic.

Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of how GitOps can benefit their teams and the tooling and process changes required to implement a reliable GitOps deployment pipeline.
