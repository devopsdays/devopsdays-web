So you’ve got Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based projects on your roadmap, but you’re not sure if you’re ready. Well, thanks to recent innovations and democratization in this space, it’s now easier than ever to get started. In this session, we will give a brief introduction to AI and Machine Learning (ML) and their importance to innovation in today’s world, and how they are shaping the future.

We will then discuss the high barrier to entry that used to exist in ML/AI space and how that barrier got reduced in recent years thanks to recent innovations like tooling, models, reusability, built-in expertise, and cloud computing building blocks. We’ll share these innovations, and the specific steps you can take to jump-start your next AI-based project. As a bonus, there will be a live demo of some of the tools you can use today to jump-start your next AI-based project.
