Setting up CI can be an arduous process; especially for those getting started. With great functionality unfortunately comes great big configuration. Thankfully, Drone CI has a local mode that allows developers to quickly setup lightweight CI and see the benefits nearly instantly.
Taking that one step further developers can use Drone’s local mode within the context of a severless function. This effectively makes Drone a serverless, ci-as-a-service, with all the scalability and low cost that comes with it.
In this talk we’ll workshop how to setup Drone for local mode and explore why (or why not) you’d want to do this. We’ll work through enabling Serverless Drone for a sample project that handles merges, and building frontend and backend docker containers.
