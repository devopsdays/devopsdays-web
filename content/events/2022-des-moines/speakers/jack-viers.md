Polyglot developer with a passion for delivering safe, performant, domain-focused and ergonomic solutions that scale to fit the needs of users and developers. I love type-systems, domain modeling, streaming data processing, messaging systems, containers, automation, build-tools, and robotics. Currently, my FOSS work is focused on bringing direct-style legible effects based on continuations to Scala as a provably equivalent alternative to the more difficult to understand monadic effect system status quo in that language. Iâ€™ve worked in PHP, Python, .NET, Java, Scala, JS, TS, and Flash/Flex in domains ranging from broadcast media to agriculture to finance, and in startups and massive corporations. Outside of work I enjoy dancing, growing things in my garden, and hanging out with my family and friends.
