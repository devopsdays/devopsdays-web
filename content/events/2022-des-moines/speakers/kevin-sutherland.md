I am an independent consultant focused on helping teams, leaders, and organizations deliver software to users, customers, and citizens. I began my career in IT working for Accenture, completing large transformational system integration projects for State government customers. Through my independent practice, I’ve discovered a passion for creating collaborative environments, facilitating continual improvement, and delivering value…and constantly learning/growing throughout the process.
I grew up in Iowa and spent the first ten years of my professional career in Sacramento, CA before moving back to Iowa to raise our two amazing kids. I spend my free time building play spaces in the yard and spending time with family and friends.
