I have over 25 years of experience in the Software Quality Assurance and Testing field. I have been involved in the implementation of test automation and performance testing solutions in hundreds of environments across a wide array of industries. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been involved with bringing quality practices (with a focus on automation and performance) to agile and DevOps teams.
