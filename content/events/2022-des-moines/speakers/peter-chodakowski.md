Peter is an agile coach with over a decade leading organizational transformation in complex industries like merchant services, agricultural financing, retail, and industrial equipment. His agile journey started in project management, then transitioned into different Scrum roles, and has since evolved into coaching teams and organizations with their digital transformations. Whether coaching, leading delivery, or helping to discover great products, Peter’s greatest joy is watching the team grow together and have fun delivering great solutions that delight customers. Peter lives on a small New Hampshire homestead farm and you may occasionally hear his rooster, Roger, crowing, “Hello!” on a conference call.
