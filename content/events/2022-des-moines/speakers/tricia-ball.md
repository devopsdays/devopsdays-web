Tricia Ball is a seasoned engineer who has spent the majority of her career building out Ruby/Rails based applications. Her work has included full-stack applications, some of which included some incredible Scriptaculous effects, spreading some love in conference management software and in-person conference tech, and most recently building out an event-driven distributed system used for content moderation. She is a person who procrastinates at writing her speaker bio, since she is not super great about talking herself up. However, she’d be happy to put you in touch with some of her colleagues from Pearson, TED Conferences, Hopin, and other past places of employment, who will only have good things to say. That said, it might take some arm twisting to be put in touch with the people who will tell you all of the rotten stuff. She is grateful for the mentors and leaders that have helped guide her through her career, and tries to pay it forward both while at work and while mentoring the kids in her town’s robotics club.
