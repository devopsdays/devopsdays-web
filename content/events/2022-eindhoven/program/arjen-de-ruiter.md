We grew from 10 people to 20, but we are not twice as fast!
We have the same team as 2 years ago, but it feels like we do less!
Do you recognise this?
Maybe you have heard it from a client, your manager or a stakeholder.
Many talks are about tools and practices. But they come and go. This talk is about the lasting principles to stay fast at scale. You can choose the tools and practices that work best for you, as long as you follow these first principles.
This talk also gives you a common language to discuss your challenges with your management and clients.
