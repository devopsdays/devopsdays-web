DORA metrics is one of the primary measurement groups of metrics to evaluate a team's performance. At Swedbank, we are embarking on the journey of breaking away from the monolith to a microservices architecture with teams owning multiple services and libraries at a time.
We have gamified some metrics to make it fun to follow, view, and have a friendly competition amongst the teams. Teams can view who is to of the leaderboard, who has what particular badge, for example for having a daily deployment streak and so on. Just like any game that players can collect badges!
