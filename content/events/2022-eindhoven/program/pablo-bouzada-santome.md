"Culture is more important than vision. Some leaders have great vision, but have created a toxic culture where that vision will never happen." Phil Cooke

The culture of an organization is the way in which things are done, the behaviors, values and practices that have been developed and reinforced over time. It is present in the way things are done in an organization. If it is good and positive, you will not realize that it's there. But, a bad system will beat a good person every time.

In this talk we will see what are the most critical factors when an organization try to change its culture, which are common issues, why some organizations or persons refuse to accept the change... and how to work with them.
