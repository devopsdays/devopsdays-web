By embracing DevOps methodology we are living in a different era: one in which the speed of new releases of software products is necessarily much higher than in the past: "Users in the business are happy with that, but security people have a lot of trouble with it". Part of the solution is the integration of automated security testing in the DevOps toolchain. This is crucial to be able to intervene quickly and on time. Every time a new version of application or process is introduced, you know that security is fact-based. This approach is also known as Evidence Based Security Testing.
