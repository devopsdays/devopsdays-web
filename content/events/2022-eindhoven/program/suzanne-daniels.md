Onboarding is difficult, finding information can be a pain, collaborating across teams or domains is hard, and no-one likes context switching between cloud portals, CI/CD Tooling and whatnot. This and other modern frustrations are causing friction in the day-to-day lives of developers.

This friction is taking away pleasure, effectiveness, and will eventually result in bad code, people leaving or being burnt out. Investing in Developer Happiness is key, but where to begin? Should you build yet another portal? Implement that new DevOps platform? Try that Inner Source thing?

In this session we're discussing all of this and take a look at Backstage, an Open Source platform you can use to build an Internal Developer Portal with and massively improve your developer experience. Because happy developers write happy code.
