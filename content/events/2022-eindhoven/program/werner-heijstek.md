Technical debt is everything in the way of getting things done. It is notoriously challenging to deal with because (1) in any given organization, there is such an awful lot of it, and (2) it is near impossible to obtain a decent budget to address it.

In this talk I want to explore a practical approach to systematically decide which technical debt to 'pay back', so that this particular investment has the highest possible return. This allows for development of convincing business cases, reduction of friction in devops and getting more things done.
