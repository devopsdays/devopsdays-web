Independent tech leader - interim manager - consultant. 
I help tech organisations to stay fast at scale, with my experience in software development, architecture and operations. I used to work for bol.com as manager for the marketing software and development platform teams. I was VPE at Sendcloud where I helped to scale from 25 to 80 people in engineering within 2 years.
