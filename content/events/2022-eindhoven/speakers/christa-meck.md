Cloud Engineering Manager at Contrast Security. 
With way more years in the industry than I have a right to, I've been around the block a time or two. I've even left, had a whole other career, and came back! I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly from the perspective of a tape operator, QA Tester, evil Project Manager, Agile partner in crime, and manager. Do not use the "it's not a sprint, it's a marathon" analogy around me or you might end up learning more than you wanted to about ultra endurance sports.
