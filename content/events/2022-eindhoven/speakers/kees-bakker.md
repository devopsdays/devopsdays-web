Iâ€™m passionate about programming, effectiveness and the beauty of a well-structured architecture. Besides hardcore coding, I like to coach and explain complex information to people. I love to take charge and improve both the team and the software. And I'm a big fan of automating tasks (using chat bots).

My tech blog KeesTalksTech.com has been running for 10 years now, so I know a thing or two about hosting WordPress applications and writing blogs.
