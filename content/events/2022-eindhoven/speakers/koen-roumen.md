At Wehkamp I am responsible for the teams that work on Store and Platform technology. Five teams at “Store” and another five teams at “Platform” report (indirectly) to me. The teams are mature and vary in size, and while we have some legacy to maintain, we mostly build new, state of the art technical solutions for everyday challenges. I am motivated by the always-changing e-commerce market, and the technical challenges we continuously face.
