Engineering Manager at Viaplay. 
I'm programmer, but my time dedicated to programming tends to 0 ... at both ends. Now I help as far as I can to make the projects go as well as possible. I like Agile because I think it's the way to do things that best suits the noble art of turning ideas into software.
