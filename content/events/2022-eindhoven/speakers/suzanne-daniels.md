Suzanne's passion is finding ways to help developers and engineers get the tools and skills to do what they do best: creating the software this world runs on while trying to innovate and make sense of buzzwords at the same time. She's organizer of events, host and a speaker on both technical topics and more in general on transformation & innovation.
