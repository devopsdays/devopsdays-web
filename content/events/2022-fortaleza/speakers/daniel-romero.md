I started my career as a sysadmin, and I worked for several years configuring and maintaining bare-metal Linux servers. Then I've closely followed the arrival of virtualization in servers and later the containerization process.
Over the years, I acquired new skills to work as a software engineer starting with PHP and Java, and then Ruby. I also worked with pentest for a few years, focused on web application security. 
I've kept myself updated and embraced the DevOps culture, working later with Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes. Currently, I can comfortably work with AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
In my most recent journey, I'm exploring Data Science and Machine Learning
