I’m an IT Professional with 15+ years of experience, especially with software development and database administration. Work with PostgreSQL since version 8.0 and today works as an SRE in a few projects.

I love learning new technologies but today I’m loving build automation tools with Go programming language and share my findings and experiences doing talks in IT events.
