I've spoken with board members from several market-leading companies. These conversations demonstrate that board members are paying close attention to their organizations' security programs, their approach and effectiveness and the impact on risk posture. Board members' influence on the direction of a company's security program has grown.

As a result, IT leaders must report regularly that security technology, people, and processes are optimized to protect and defend the organization so that when a breach or attack does take place, it will have minimal impact on the brand and bottom line.
