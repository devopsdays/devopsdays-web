Two years ago, we implemented the first Mob Programming pilot at Delta's Dojo, an 8 week immersive experience for IT teams. Mob Programming is a technique used to write software code utilizing 4-5 team members instead of a single programmer which reduces costs by 9% per deployment. The pilot's success has led this practice to be mainstream at Delta. The talk begins by giving context on how mobbing was first introduced and later adopted by Delta Air Lines. I then dive deep into best practices for success and tangible outcomes that materialize almost immediately from this new way of working.
