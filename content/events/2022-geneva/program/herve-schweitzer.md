Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management and provision of infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, which has developed significantly in the past years, primarily due to DevOps environments.

This solution approach is very practical to enable environment provisioning quickly, comprehensibly and repeatably. This is beneficial for developing environments.

But how managed that in productive multi-cloud environments, where each cloud provider has its own products to deploy infrastructures with code,  which make that complex to manage and maintain.
