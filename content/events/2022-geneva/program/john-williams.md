Almost two years ago we started a team at Basecamp focusing on operational preparedness.

In this talk I will discuss how we maintain operational preparedness for many critical failures, first by building resilience into our applications and second, by validating this resilience through extensive failure testing.

We will also dive into how we continually test our infrastructure tooling and documentation. A tool is only as good as the instructions to use it.
