This talks is inspired by the FridayForFuture movement:

- What can we learn from the FFF movement for our DevOps journey ?
- Do we have to take care as IT'ler for a Green world ?
- Or how perhaps our it decisions will be influenced by a world that is focussing more and more on CO2 reductions.
- What is the implication on our value delivering story ?
