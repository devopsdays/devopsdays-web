Digital transformation initiatives drive teams and organizations to transition their technology architectures to more modern concepts such as microservices, APIs and serverless frameworks. The distributed nature of these composed architectures are surfacing significant obstacles in developing continuous delivery strategies that orchestrate and support effective CI/CD practices. In this talk, the presenter will discuss some challenges associated with CI/CD and composed architectures. They will also offer some strategies on how to understand and potentially solve common challenges teams face.
