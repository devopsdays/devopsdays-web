The standard for a reliable system is 99.99% uptime, which requires teams to have full visibility into their systems to quickly find and fix issues. With the rise of distributed applications spanning the cloud, on-prem deployments, and SaaS solutions, it becomes increasingly complex to pinpoint and find the root cause of performance issues.

In this session, we will discuss the complexities that come alongside getting visibility into your distributed systems running in the cloud as they scale. Then learn how OpenTelemetry collects, processes, and forwards telemetry data from your applications to your observability solution, enabling end-to-end visibility to quickly identify and fix issues.
