When thinking about a DevOps culture, we all come to the concept with different ideas, experiences, and knowledge, and we all are part of different communities of practice in both our workplaces and our general communities. Similarly, our organizations contain multiple points of view and multiple communities of practice. However, we’re all dealing with complex systems for which a change in perspective is needed to build something bigger than ourselves or our single point of view. To get to a true “DevOps transformation” in any organization, we have to make a fundamental shift in the ways our internal communities of practice think and bring together groups of people to drive new ideas. Come chat with Laura as she shares her experiences building communities and studying systems to explore how you can influence your organization’s shift to DevOps.
