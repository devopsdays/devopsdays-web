We work in a fast paced, constantly growing, high demand industry that is known for creating burnout and apathy for teams who constantly live under this emotional pressure. Tropes like “people quit managers not jobs” aren’t enough to guide us to real solutions. Over the last 13 years I’ve helped growing a company from 40 employees to 1,500 employees and regular winner of Best Places to Work awards. To avoid the pitfalls we must balance two critical areas, engaging minds and engaging hearts. Come learn how to use Autonomy, Mastery, and Achievement to engage minds, and balance that with Purpose and Appreciation to engage hearts.
