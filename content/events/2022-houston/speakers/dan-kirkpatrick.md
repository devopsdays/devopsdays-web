 I've been working with Kubernetes in production environments since 2016, working as a consultant with companies across a number of industries, including healthcare, banking, oil & gas, and transportation. Regardless of the industry, I see the same results as organizations adopt Kubernetes: Kubernetes is hard, with a lot to learn; it can be opaque working in "the cloud" instead of developing locally; developers fear accidentally incurring large cloud computing bills. I've discovered that the interactivity of Jupyter Notebooks to install and operate Kubernetes components locally is the best way to learn. By setting up a complete Internal Developer Platform, developers can learn, develop, and deliver software faster and easier than ever.
