In order to understand current IT organizations, Patrick has taken a habit of changing both his consultancy role and the domain which he works in: sometimes as a developer, manager, sysadmin, tester and even as the customer. . He is also a co-author of “The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations” with Gene Kim, John Willis, and Jez Humble. He first presented concepts on Agile Infrastructure at Agile 2008 in Toronto, and in 2009 he organized the first DevOpsDays. Since then he has been promoting the notion of ‘devops’ to exchange ideas between these groups and show how they can help each other to achieve better results in business. More recently he has been focusing on DevSecOps to make the world a safer place.
