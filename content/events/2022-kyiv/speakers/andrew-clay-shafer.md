Andrew Clay Shafer is VP of Transformation, Global Transformation Office for Red Hat. Always fascinated with the dynamics of high performing individuals and organizations, Andrew has a long history helping people deliver systems with better tools and processes. 

With more than 20 years of experience in technology, he gravitated to Agile and Lean methods as a software developer and then applied this understanding to systems as the cofounder of Puppet. Andrew evangelized DevOps tools and practices before DevOps was a word and helped to organize DevOpsDays events since the earliest days of the movement.
