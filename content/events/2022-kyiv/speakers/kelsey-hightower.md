As a curious and motivated self-learner, I gained an interest in computing at a young age, and started my IT career by opening a small consulting shop 20 years ago.

From those beginnings my career progressed quickly, eventually passing through the halls of Google, Puppet Labs, New Relic and CoreOS. I am a system administrator by trade, a programmer by necessity, but a problem-solver at heart.

With a passion for helping others, many successful speaking and teaching engagements under my belt, and a proven track record of getting things done and enabling others, I hope to solve the many problems facing IT culture by equipping people with the mental and computational software they need to succeed in the competitive world of technology.
