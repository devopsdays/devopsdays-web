We've all had moments when our blood runs cold and we realise we've done something that feels catastrophically bad. We're getting better at this as an industry. Blameless post-mortems are more common and the days of wearing the hat of shame or buy the beers when you break prod have, thankfully, mostly gone. But there is still a stigma attached to talking about messing up. 

As humans we are mostly terrible about talking about our failures. But by exploring our, often deep rooted, reactions to mistakes, and normalising getting it wrong we can work towards a truly blameless culture and make it a lot easier to learn from what has happened and move on.
