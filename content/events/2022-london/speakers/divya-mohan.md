A documentation ninja with SUSE at her day job, Divya Mohan has 8 years of systems engineering expertise under her belt (or what could be called a belt before the pandemic). Over the course of her transition from corporate to the open source ecosystem in which she works currently, she also has extensive experience trying to recruit and be recruited as a "DevOps engineer". But in vain, because DevOps engineers are like unicorns. They don't exist. A firm believer in the power of community education, she is a CNCF ambassador, an AWS community builder, and a co-organizer of the CNCF Student User Group.
