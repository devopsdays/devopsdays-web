Elora is a Platform Engineering Manager at Depop, a recent change since they made the jump from their previous role as a Senior Platform Engineer at Anaplan. They have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a deep seated impatience for bloated processes. After hitting the software scene full-time in 2018, they’ve been obsessed with how code gets from commit to production. Ever since, they’ve been working their way from service development to infrastructure and developer tooling, causing trouble all the way. If you have ideas or methods for testing CI/CD pipelines, please talk to them!Ignite Title: “Customer-Driven” Platform Teams
