Floor is a Staff Developer Advocate at Aiven(.io), the open source DBaaS company. Previously she worked in Developer Relations roles at Grafana Labs and Microsoft. She co-organizes devopsdays Amsterdam and devopsdays Eindhoven, as well as several meetup groups including contributing.today, a monthly virtual-first-an-only meetup on open source topics. 

Floor is an active member of the Ruby community, organizing conferences and meetups. In 2020 she worked on the Git Inclusion Summit with members of Googleâ€™s Open Source Program Office, for the 40-or-so core contributors of Git. 

In her spare time, Floor tends to her chickens, dog and son (not necessarily in that order), and she knits.
