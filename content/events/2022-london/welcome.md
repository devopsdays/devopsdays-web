      <p>For this year’s event, we’ll be implementing the following safety measures to prevent the spread of Covid. We encourage all
        attendees to practice mask-wearing and engage in social distancing in all enclosed spaces throughout the venue. To guarantee entry, we will require either proof of vaccination status or a negative lateral flow test completed on the same day if you are unable to take the vaccine. These measures will be reviewed and updated to reflect the changing situation and number of cases as we approach the date of the conference. We’ll also be offering a virtual attendance option for those unable to attend.</p>

    <p>The first DevOpsDays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. Since then, DevOpsDays events have multiplied and expanded globally with over 55 events in for 2018.</p>
    <p>DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from community, for the benefit of the community.
      We are not a commercial conference and we believe that our focus on serving the community creates a truly unique experience for both delegates and sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>We expect 350 people (depending on COVID-19 guidance) this year and will be holding the event on September 29-30th at the
      Kia Oval, Kennington, London.</p>
    <p>For the first time this year we will offer interactive online tickets as well.</p>
    <p>The format of DevOpsDays London includes a single track of 30 minute talks in the morning of each event, followed by Ignite talks (5 minute, auto forwarding). We spend the rest of the afternoon in Open Spaces, which are considered a key portion
      of the event.
