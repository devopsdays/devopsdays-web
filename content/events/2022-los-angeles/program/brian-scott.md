This will be an interview-style discussion between Kevin Nelson, Staff Develop Advocate, on Google's Enterprise Customer Advocacy Team and Brian Scott, Sr SRE at Disney. Almost every company in the world is struggling with whether and how to implement SRE practices in order to increase the speed of their software innovation while simultaneously trying to keep the lights on for their existing software stack. Disney has aggressively implemented SRE practices in several internal organizations and is seeing significant benefits, but there's still lots of work to be done. Brian will talk about the real-world issues he's faced in rolling out this new practice across a large, distributed organization.
