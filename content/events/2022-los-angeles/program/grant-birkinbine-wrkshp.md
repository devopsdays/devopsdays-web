## Title:
DevOps for Fun and Profit: Deploying an App in Dev and Production

## Presenters:
Murriel Grace & Grant Birkinbine

## Description:
Join us for a hands-on DevOps Journey! Attendees of this workshop will have the opportunity to experience several stages in the software development lifecycle during this interactive workshop. 

You will be hands-on in the terminal and IDE interacting with code and various open-source tools. Once you have successfully built and edited your application, we will go live and launch into production! This workshop will be helpful to anyone that would like to learn more about the software lifecycle, whether you have experience in development, operations, testing, or anything in between.

Walk away with a functioning sample application in your very own GitHub repository!

## Workshop Requirements:
Bring your laptop with your favorite IDE installed (if you need a recommendation, start with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Also, if you don't have a GitHub account, please set one up prior to attending the workshop.
