How really important are mentorship and documentation to the survival of civilization? What would happen if we lost everything and had to start over, say, due to a global pandemic? We talk a lot about mentorship in the tech industry, but what do we really mean? Are we setting people up for success? In this talk, we'll explore and seek to answer these questions, and come to some action steps to do our part.
