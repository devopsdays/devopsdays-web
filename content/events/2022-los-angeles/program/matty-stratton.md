We have been talking about devops for years. Along the way, we’ve added various syllables to the portmanteau “devops” to include all the practices and disciplines that are key to doing this effectively. What if DevOps, DevSecOps, and all the other variants have been about the same idea all along?

Cloud Engineering is an emergent way of expressing how we use and enhance software engineering  practices in a cloud world. This goes beyond application design and architecture, but includes how we build, deploy, and manage the services and applications that provide value to our users and customers.

In this talk I will step through the evolution of devops and how the practice of Cloud Engineering is a natural progression. I will take the traditional expression of CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing) and connect them to the build, deploy, and manage practices reflected in the Cloud Engineering discipline.
