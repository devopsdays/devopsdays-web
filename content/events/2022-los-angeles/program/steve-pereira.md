How can you make time for real innovation and improvement?   
How do you know what to automate?   
How do you escape process prison?   
How can you get everyone aligned to make a difference?   
How do you get from where you are to your next performance target?  
  
This is an introduction to 4 valuable mapping techniques and models that build clarity, alignment, and confidence in teams using a combination of collaboration, visibility and measurement.

I'll introduce 4 powerful maps: Outcome, Value Stream, Dependency, and Capability, that you can co-create with your teams to uncover hidden insights and opportunities. I'll show you how to take those insights and create a powerful roadmap of actions and experiments to dramatically improve flow and deliver continuous value.

Flow Engineering builds on the lean practice of Value Stream design and improvement as a framework of techniques you can use right now to reveal your biggest opportunities to eliminate hours of friction every week, so you can invest in what's next.   
  
Use it to improve your:  
- Development process  
- Planning and shaping  
- Delivery/Data/Testing/Analytics/Logging Pipeline  
- Employee/Customer Onboarding  
- Support/Failure Recovery/Incident Management
- Workflow of choice
â€¦and start spending more time on what's next
