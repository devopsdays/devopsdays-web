DevOps culture challenges traditional organizational silos, internal departmental goals, and traditional ways of working. When you're looking to introduce a change into your organization, people will have questions about what you're trying to change, why, how urgent it is, when, etc. Your case for change answers these questions BUT tailoring it to achieve specific outcomes turns your case into a powerful tool to align people and get the support you need.

In this lightning talk, I'll outline the important elements you'll need to create your case for change, show examples of what good looks like (and not so good), and then apply a method to tailor your case for specific groups and audiences to achieve positive outcomes.
