Dan here. A few things about me… First of all, the only thing I find more awkward than writing a bio about myself is asking someone else to write one about me. So first person it is! I’m a software engineer at heart. Two years ago I started a company with another engineer, my co-founder Ori Keren. I pulled the short straw so actually at the moment I’m responsible for customer success, marketing and sales. Which is crazy because I had never done any of those things before LinearB. I wish I had more time to write code but I love being customer facing because I’m learning a lot of new stuff. Before LinearB I was a dev team lead, and VP of Engineering. I’m obsessed with how dev teams work together. Like what makes great culture? And how can engineering leaders be data-driven without being performance tyrants? And why can cars drive themselves but I have to spend 30 minutes every day manually updating my project tickets? :-) More importantly, my partner Lauren and I just had a beautiful baby girl named Leila. We recently moved to sunny Southern California which is a welcome change for this suburban boy from up-state New York.
