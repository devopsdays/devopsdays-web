Hannah is a Senior Engineering Manager at CircleCI. She manages three teams in the Engineering Efficiency space. The examples in this presentation are drawn from her work with the Backplane Team and its excellent engineers.

Hannah knows a lot about managing remote teams, managing expectations, continuous integration and delivery, developer tools, and learning to Clojure. She has an irredeemably cheesy sense of humor.
