Bio: Iâ€™m passionate about helping organizations work in new ways and adopt technologies to achieve value faster. Over the past "more than I care to admit to" years, I held both technology leadership and consulting roles in organizations ranging from startups to global Fortune 100 companies.

Today, I'm fortunate to work for Mattel (the Barbie, Hot Wheels, etc people) as the Director IT - OCM and Change Enablement where I lead an amazing team in accelerating the value of transformations globally. In addition, I work with the Global Technology Organization's leadership in identifying and driving opportunities to enhance our culture, support better ways of working together, and ensure a high level of employee engagement.

For the second year in a row, Mattel has been certified as "A Great Place To Work" and we were recently honored as a CIO 100 winner, celebrating IT organizations for driving digital business growth through technology innovation.
