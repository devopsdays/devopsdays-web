<h3>About DevOpsDayLA</h3>

DevOpsDaysLA, now in its 10th year, is Southern California's only annual conference focused on the practice of DevOps. The conference provides a relaxed, casual, and diverse environment where sponsors connect with talent, demonstrate the latest tools, and offer world class services to facilitate organizations' DevOps journey. 

<h3>DevOpsDayLA Conference Profile</h3>

- 8 Speakers ( 5 Long Form Talks, 3 Lightning Talks - including John Willis, co-author of the DevOps Handbook in 2 of the last 4 conferences)
  - 33% of Speakers are typically women

<p>
There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. We'll have sponsors for various events with special privileges for the sponsors of these events. If you are interested in special sponsorships or have a creative idea about how you can support the event, send us an email.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
