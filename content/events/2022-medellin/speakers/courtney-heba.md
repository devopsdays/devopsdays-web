Technical wizard at Microsoft supporting Teams, saving the world from Zoom since Aug. 2021. Before Microsoft, I led the e-Commerce scrum teams at Carters | Oshkosh B'gosh, was an Enterprise Agile Coach at Delta Air Lines, and rounded out my experience as an Enterprise seller at AT&T. To foster my value of learning, I teach C# programming to seniors as an adjunct professor at Georgia Gwinnett College. I received my MBA from Georgia Tech with a 6 Sigma Black Belt in 2017.
