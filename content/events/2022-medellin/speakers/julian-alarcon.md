Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer who loves open source software culture, sharing my knowledge and working on weird and wonderful projects than allows me to think outside the box.

I enjoy learning from new cultures and try to experience one new thing every day.

With a technical background spanning almost 10 years, I help to bring big ideas to life.

A coffee lover from a coffee country, an amateur photographer and a great conversationalist, especially when beer is involved.
