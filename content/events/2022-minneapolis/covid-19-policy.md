In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, devopsdays Minneapolis is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2022 event:

  * We are requiring vaccination for in-person attendance. All in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) must have completed a full primary series of a government-approved COVID-19 vaccination at least two (2) weeks prior to this event, by July 17, 2022. Boosters are optional but encouraged.

  * We will require you to show your vaccination card (photo okay) or app for badge pickup. If you don't have it with you, we'll ask you to leave until you can produce it. Test results are not accepted as a substitute for vaccination.

  * We are requiring masks for in-person attendance. Masks must be worn over the nose and mouth and must be made of a tight-knit, non-permeable material. KN95, KF94, or N95 masks are recommended; we will have multiple colors of KN95 masks available at registration. Cloth masks are acceptable, but bandanas, scarves, bead, sequin, or mesh masks, and gators are not.

  * Speakers and staff are not required to wear masks while on stage. Staff, speakers, attendees, and sponsors may remove masks indoors while actively eating and drinking, but must replace masks after consuming food and beverage. Masks are not required outdoors or in parts of the hotel like the lobby that are outside our conference space.

  * If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
