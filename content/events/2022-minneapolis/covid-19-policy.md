In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, devopsdays Minneapolis is instituting the following COVID-19 policy for our 2022 event:

  * We are requiring vaccination for in-person attendance. If you are not able to show proof of vaccination, you are invited to participate online. Specifically, all in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) must have completed a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two (2) weeks prior to this event, by July 17, 2022. We will require a vaccination card or app plus matching ID for badge pickup.

  * While local mask mandates have been lifted, at this time masks will still be required to be worn at our event. We are paying close attention to the [Minnesota Department of Health Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/facecover.html) and the [City of Minneapolis: COVID-19 Health & Safety Information](https://www.minneapolis.org/covid-19-health-safety/). We reserve the right to adjust mask requirements based on conditions at the time of the event.

  * If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by July 17, 2022 if applicable and participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.
