What comes next after clouds, containers, and Kubernetes? Glad you asked! Michelle introduces us to [Spin](https://spin.fermyon.dev/), a framework for building and running event-driven microservice applications with WebAssembly (Wasm) components. With Spin, Michelle and her Fermyon team make it easier to get started with using WebAssembly on the server, with the result that we can all take advantage of the security, portability, and speed of WebAssembly.
