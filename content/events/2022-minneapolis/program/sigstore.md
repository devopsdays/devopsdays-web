You're familiar with containers and Kubernetes, but suddenly people are talking about supply chains, and you're pretty sure they don't mean the Suez Canal. Join  Jeffrey Sica and Bob Killen for an in-depth look at the nuts, bolts, and metaphorical shipping containers that make up modern container supply chain security. They'll demo sigstore and show how container signing automation works with Kubernetes. You'll leave prepared to make decisions that will keep your org unstuck.
