Have a task that’s supposed to be easy? You could do it in a snap? You know you really should get it done, and yet… you just can’t bring yourself to do it?

This talk presents the concept of the Wall of Awful, a metaphor for emotional barriers that keep us from doing the things we supposedly want to do and tactics for getting past these blockers and to your goal.
