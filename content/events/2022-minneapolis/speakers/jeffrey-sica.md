Jeffrey is a Principal Developer Experience Engineer at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes contributor, and open source software advocate. When not poking holes at test plans, he can usually be found working on upstream Kubernetes in various sub-projects or posting an unhealthy amount of GIFs on Twitter. He is a Goose Enthusiast and enjoys referring to himself as a Michigander (though has relocated to Minnesota).
