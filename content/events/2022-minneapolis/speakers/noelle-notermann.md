Dr. Noelle Notermann is currently a Senior Software Engineer for a large, local employer. Previously, she worked at the University of Minnesota as a DevOps Engineer supporting ERP software and also as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer.

Prior to making a career change into tech, she spent half a decade as a law school Director of Student Affairs and Registrar, where she excelled at student leader development, change management, and policy and program design and implementation. Wanting to give back to the community, she has served as a volunteer facilitative mediator and conflict coach for many years, and feels that teaching others the skills to engage in healthy and productive conflict can become a core component of their overall wellbeing.

When she’s not busy chasing around small human beings (who evidently did not inherit her passion for “productive and thoughtful conflict resolution”), she uses the very little time left over to sing professionally as a soloist and choral section leader.
