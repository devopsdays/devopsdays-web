If you would like to discuss your existing sponsorship, please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}]. Sponsorships are now closed for our 2022 event.

We greatly value sponsors for this community event. Platinum, Gold, and Silver sponsorship packages are detailed in our <a href="https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2022/minneapolis/devopsdays-minneapolis-2022-prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a>.

Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media. Sponsors are encouraged to actively participate and engage with the attendees as peers. All participants including sponsors are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so a discussion will be more appealing than a pitch. Your technical team members may get great insights from the attendee-directed discussions.
