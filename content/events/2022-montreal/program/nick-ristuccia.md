Bravely go where no developer has gone before. Science-fiction is known for inspiring wonder and creativity. This interactive session presents science-fiction scenarios. Its card-game approach challenges you to propose how today’s C/C++ libraries can make these scenarios a reality. You’ll think critically about various libraries and become familiar with them in ways you may not have thought possible. Science-fiction fans and developers of all experience levels are welcome to join. This session also reflects on the state of the C/C++ ecosystem, the realities of development, and tools like Conan for managing libraries.
