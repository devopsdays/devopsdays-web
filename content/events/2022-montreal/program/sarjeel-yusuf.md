On-call management and the basic culture around on-call have been pretty much stagnant in the way we perform it since. Hence this has led to a very critical practice not evolving to solve the pain points that actual on-call responders deal with. Hence this talk aims to deconstruct the on-call practice and reconstruct it with a more human first approach while not compromising the system requirements of on-call.
