I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph, though I'll be a new grad at the time of the event. I'm the co-president of the Guelph Women in Computer Science club and I'm passionate about creating an inclusive space in computer science for women and non-binary individuals. I've given many talks about Imposter Syndrome and Poetry in Code to my club, my university, the companies I've worked for, and even companies I haven't worked for, such as Microsoft!
