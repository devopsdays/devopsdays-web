Client-focused, analytical, and multidisciplinary, Kevork is a senior dev with a passion for automation and simplification in JDK application-based environments (Java, Kotlin) that are integrated using orchestrators such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins and deployed using containers orchestrated by Kubernetes. Test automation is also one of his big focuses, ensuring proper unit integration tests, but also end-to-end tests using Cucumber-based frameworks to deliver and maintain tests understandable by all human beings (not just devs!). With a specialization in SRE practices such as resiliency and observability, Kevork brings an expertise that encompasses the process development, including automation and reliability to ensure continuous delivery and improvement. Personally, Kevork is an open source enthusiast (all hail tux!), an automotive fan, and tries to stay physically active by jogging, which also helps him brainstorm solutions for his lines of code that just won't work.
