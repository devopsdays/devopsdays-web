Nick started in the videogames industry where he developed titles for Wii, DS, 3DS, PS3, 360, iOS, and Android. He escaped from the game studios to work at tech companies. As a Curriculum Developer at Oracle, he focused Java programming and certification. As a Developer Advocate at JFrog, his focus in on C++ package management, IoT, and other JFrog technologies. Heâ€™s often disappointed by the oppressive corporate feel of traditional technical training, which motivates him to create more engaging and powerful leaning experiences through games and other playful techniques. His ideal is a mix of creative and technical challenges.
