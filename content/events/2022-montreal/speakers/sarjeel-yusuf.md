As a product manager at Datadog, and ex-DevOps product manager at Atlassian, I have been fixated on building products that enhance how teams and organizations practice DevOps. Hence I have also been talking about how we can improve the way we build cloud applications, and a list of my past talks can be found on my website here: https://sarjeelyusuf.me/
