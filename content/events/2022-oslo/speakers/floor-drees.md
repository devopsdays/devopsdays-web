Staff Developer Advocate at Aiven

I'm a Staff Developer Advocate at Aiven(.io),we’re a managed solution for your favorite open source data tools. Previously I worked in Developer Relations roles at Grafana Labs and Microsoft. I co-organize devopsdays Amsterdam and devopsdays Eindhoven, as well as several meetup groups including contributing.today, a monthly virtual-first-an-only meetup on open source topics.

I’m a devopsdays core member, and a Microsoft MVP, awarded for my community work in the developer technologies space.

I talk about dinosaurs and chickens a lot.
