Today, one way or another, organisations are leveraging cloud to gain speed and agility to achieve their business goals. A DevOps and Cloud-native mindset is nowadays intrrisecly part of modern software development. The vast majority of organisations are already there, or giving steps towards it.

However, after adopting DevOps and becoming cloud-native, itâ€™s hard to evaluate the organization maturity state and understand if it continues to evolute towards the right direction.

In this talk, I share some real-world experiences, war stories and best practices for software engineers, engineering managers and technical leaders that want to drive their organisations towards engineering excellence - regardless on their organisational type (startup vs enterprise) and cloud strategy (single vs multi-cloud).
