Why are so many organizations stuck in the “middle” of DevOps evolution? What’s preventing them from achieving higher levels of performance despite all the automation, tooling, and good practices in place?

Puppet’s State of DevOps Report 2021 provides important research-based clues to answer these questions, supported by the patterns and recommendations in Team Topologies.

In this talk we cover the self-imposed limitations of blindly following some “myths” around DevOps. Almost 80% of organizations are stuck in the “frozen middle” of DevOps evolution because of lack of organizational sensemaking abilities. The margin for growth for these organizations is tremendous, but they need to think beyond technical capabilities to unlock the potential of their teams to deliver with more autonomy and a sense of purpose.

The data shows that Team Topologies provides the necessary organizational and team interaction patterns that help organizations achieve performance metrics such as delivering a new customer change request to live in under one hour, or diagnosing and recovering from a serious issue in production in under an hour.

Fundamentally, we need to supercharge the fundamental principles of DevOps: fast feedback loops, minimal waste, removing bottlenecks, and continuous learning & improvement.
