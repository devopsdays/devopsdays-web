The digital world requires speed. Businesses have to shorten their lead times for just about everything they do. But they often view speed as a threat to control; how can they govern and oversee things that are moving faster and faster? How can they ensure security and manage costs and stay compliant with regulatory frameworks? Surprisingly for some, it turns out that speed actually increases companies’ ability to govern and oversee, and it makes it easier for them to stay compliant. To demonstrate that, I’ll draw on the history of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812, the state of the art in Cloud and DevOps, and the experience of Amazon Web Services in driving continuous innovation.
