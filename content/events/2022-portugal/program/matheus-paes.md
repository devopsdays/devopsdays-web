Imagine how to support around 800 developers in a fintech that is on growing fast in the South America market, the ecosystem is polyglot (Java, GoLang, Python, PHP) which gives an additional complexity on how to avoid lack of knowledge between the infrastructure, coding best practices, and business needs. This is what led us to decide to build an Internal Platform as a Product, this is an approach to face the challenge of complex environments, the main goal is to improve de the developersâ€™ productivity and also keep the cognitive effort low as possible. This presentation will show a possible way to start establishing platform teams and the benefits to do that for the organizations.
