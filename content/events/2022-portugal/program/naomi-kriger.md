Major pains in systems handover, onboarding new employees, debugging dark sides of code, and answering “why” and “how” questions occur when we lack well-written technical documentation.

In this talk, I’ll show you a structured way to write great technical docs, without being a technical writer, so you will deliver highly valuable content to your audience. I’ll explain why you should care about these docs and how they serve your best interests (yes, there are quite a few).

From personal and collective ramp-up, through career development and the ability to impact your surroundings - technical writing is the skill to achieve your goals.
