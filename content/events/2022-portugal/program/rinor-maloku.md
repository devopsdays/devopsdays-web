In this talk, Iâ€™m exploring how someone can use eBPF to get insights about the communications happening in a Kubernetes cluster. I write an eBPF program and then use the BumbleBee (https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee) open source project to build and deploy it. This program gathers information about all the network communications happening in the cluster and publish the corresponding metrics that I store on Prometheus. I then deploy a service gets the metrics and correlate them with the Pod and Service IP addresses to build a graph displaying all the communications.
