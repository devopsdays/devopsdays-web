João is a Principal Automation Engineer at Farfetch, working with the infrastructure teams on the eternal quest to do more, better and faster, with less. Previous engagements included developing a self-service fully-automated infrastructure platform based on rather sizeable on-premise OpenStack Instances at PaddyPower-Betfair, and more humble beginnings as a web-oriented Python developer who dabbed in infrastructure more for fun than for profit. 

When off the clock, he's likely to be found wrenching on or riding his motorcycle, traveling or going down some snowy mountains.
