Mark Schwartz joined AWS as an Enterprise Strategist and Evangelist in July 2017. In this role,
Mark works with enterprise technology executives to share experiences and strategies for how
the cloud can help them increase speed and agility while devoting more of their resources to
their customers.

Mark has extensive experience as an IT leader in the government, private sector, and the
nonprofit world, and with organizations ranging from startup to large. Prior to joining AWS, he
was CIO of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (in the Department of Homeland Security),
where he led a large digital transformation effort, moving the agency to the cloud, introducing
and refining DevOps and Agile techniques, and adopting user-centric design approaches. From
his work at USCIS, he developed a reputation for leading transformation in organizations that
are resistant to change, obsessed with security, subject to considerable regulation and
oversight, and deeply bureaucratic. Before USCIS, Mark was CIO of Intrax Cultural Exchange, a
leader in global youth exchange programs, and CEO of a software company.
