Yuri Sa has been involved in helping companies to achieve the next level of automation in their infrastructure environment. Throughout his 13 years of experience, he worked in critical environments related to supply chain companies.

One of his central beliefs is that all barriers between Developers and Operations teams should be removed; for that reason, he decided to create a Podcast called "Eu DevOps" which has been discussing topics on how the community could advocate the DevOps culture more efficiently.
