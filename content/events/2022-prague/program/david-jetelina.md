Not too long ago my company started growing, mostly through acquisitions of platforms that in the end connected 9 European markets. As we became more serious about working together, it was obvious everybody does and understands ‘DevOps’ differently. I’d like to share my experience leading a collective design process we called ‘DevOps Implementation’, through which we tried to clarify many things and unify how we work. Which roles should be present in the company? What responsibilities belong to whom?
