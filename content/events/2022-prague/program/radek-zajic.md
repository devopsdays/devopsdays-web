The workshop will recap what IPv6 is and what's the support of it in the world of AWS, guide you through initial set-up of IPv6 in the AWS environment (VPC, EC2 instances, security groups, load balancers and target groups, CloudFront) and show you how to save your organization some $$$ by not routing traffic through the expensive NAT gateway. Have your lab accounts ready!
