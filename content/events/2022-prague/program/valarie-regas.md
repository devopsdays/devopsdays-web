Rebuilding Together takes a critical look at the realities facing the tech community in post-pandemic, now endemic, life. I explore what the future might look like, if we all work together towards a new normal, based on empathy, compassion, and community. Rather than giving vague platitudes concerning the work ahead of us, I issue concrete, actionable tasks to us all, such that every attendee leaves with an idea of how to rebuild, and help the tech community thrive again.
