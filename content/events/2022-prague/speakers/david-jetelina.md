I am an Infrastructure Engineer, although not too long ago I was a Software Engineer. DevOps as a cultural topic was very close to my heart, pretty much since the first time I had to throw a package with my application over a wall to an admin with instructions in an environment I knew almost nothing about, it didnâ€™t feel right.

Currently my team is building and designing an infrastructure layer (development tools -> workflows) on top of GCP, while maintaining our deprecated on-prem infrastructure.
