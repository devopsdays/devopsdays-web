Radek is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to infrastructure. He's working for the dark side of the infrastructure operations for nearly two decades now, often crossing the boundaries and peeking into the development world.

His focus these days is on Linux-based infrastructure, both in the cloud and on the bare metal servers. He's currently engaged in maintaining the content delivery infrastructure for Showmax.com, the African video streaming service.

As Radek believes we should all focus on the future of the Internet, he's a heavy promoter of the deployment of IPv6, the current internet protocol. And that's what he will guide us through on DevOpsDays Prague 2022.
