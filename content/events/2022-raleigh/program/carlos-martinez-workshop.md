This vendor neutral session will be conducted by the security person responsible for the zero trust implementation at two Fortune 500 global enterprises, serving over 150,000 users. It will focus on breaking down all of the core components of a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) architecture and thoroughly explain how all these pieces all work together. Attendees will have a better practical understanding of what they need to get started with their Zero Trust initiative.* First, students will learn about the key components of a Zero Trust architecture - PKI, Native app, Identity Provider, Identity-Aware Proxy, Policy Engine.* Next, attendees will learn how these different building blocks can be integrated together to apply zero trust principals to protect corporate assets and prevent lateral movement. * In the hands-on portion of this session, attendees will create a personalized Zero Trust demo environment that puts the theory they've learned into practice.
