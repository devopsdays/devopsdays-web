How one DevOps engineer can support hundreds of open-source developers, across multiple source repositories, with over 100,000 reliable and predictable orchestrated VMs.  Part personal journey, and part destination overview.  I"ll focus on automation and orchestration for CI Testing of public/open-source projects with a sideways-glance towards operational-security.  Specific technologies will be used as examples, but the techniques discussed are generally applicable, and not cloud or widget specific.
