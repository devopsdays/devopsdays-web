Title = "Workshop - Enter Serverless Functions Journey with Quarkus"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["daniel-oh"]
+++

This workshop is designed to be hands-on experiences on how developers can get started with scaffolding serverless functions projects using Quarkus, a new Kubernetes native Java framework with familiar tools (e.g. CLI, Maven, Gradel). The workshop covers deploying service functions to AWS Lambda, optimizing the functions, making them portable across multiple serverless platforms ( e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Function, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes Knative), and using the latest handy command-line tool (e.g. Kn func) to enable a Buildpack for function development & deployment in minutes. Lab participants will be provided a free sandbox for serverless deployments.This hands-on lab showcases how quickly developers can create cloud-native microservice projects using Quarkus. Then, the application can be deployed to a function to AWS Lambda and OpenShift Serverless with JVM and Native mode.
