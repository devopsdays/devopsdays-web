You've heard of large scale open source architectures, but have you ever wanted to take a serious look at these real life enterprise DevOps implementations that scale? This session takes attendees on a tour of multiple use cases covering DevOps challenges with hybrid cloud management with GitOps, DevOps in healthcare, and much more. Not only are these architectures interesting, but they are successful real life implementations featuring open source technologies and power many of your own online experiences. The attendee departs this session with a working knowledge of how to map general open source technologies to their solutions. Material covered is available freely online and attendees can use these solutions as starting points for aligning to their own solution architectures. Join us for an hour of power as we talk architecture shop!
