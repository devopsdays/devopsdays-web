So you're ready to hire someone to help with user experience. You've identified usability issues with your sites, apps, or other software products, and need someone to help fix them, a single usability professional to "do UX"—whatever that means. I'm sorry to tell you, this person does not exist. And, if you try to foist all of your usability problems onto one professional, you will not get the rainbow-filled success you're hoping for.While UX professionals might be pretty magical beings, no one person can juggle all of the areas of expertise needed for top-tier user experience. Having a full, well-rounded usability team is always ideal. But we don't live in a world of unicorns or ideals. You may only be able to get the budget, resources, or go-ahead for one UX hire.If that's where you're at, not all is lost. You can still create more useful, usable sites and apps with a single, strategic UX hire. To make this work, you'll need to focus less on one person to do all things UX and more on how your lone UX pro will fit into the team and skillsets you already have.Attendees will walk away being able to:1. Make an honest assessment of their team's strengths and weaknesses.2. Understand the value of embedding UX in their existing team structure.3. Take concrete steps towards happier users and improved success online.
