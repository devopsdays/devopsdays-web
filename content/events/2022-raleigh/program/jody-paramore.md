Wake Early College of Health & Science is in our piloting year of a new project, WECHS H.E.A.L.S., that allows 9th & 10th grade students to work in collaborative teams to identify and solve a health science challenge through an equity lens. Student inquiry projects will focus on health science challenges enshrined in the 2030 targets set for United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. Student teams are examining health science challenges from local and global lenses, connecting with field experts, and will be sharing research findings and solutions, which may include fabrication solution prototypes and social awareness campaigns.
