+++

In this talk, we will take a look "under the hood" at a real-world CloudBees CD installation that SPK and Associates did in 2021.  To do this, we'll show the good, the bad and the ugly in an effort to educate others on what to look for in their own CI/CD implementations.The first stage of this engagement was a discovery, which afforded the SPK team some major surprises, including understanding existing deployment tasks, software involved, and diagrams.  This is where many surprises and some of the "bad and ugly" come from for this story.The next stages of this engagement talk about how engineers collaborated to implement proper technical practices, CloudBees CD, and other tools to help automate manual tasks, and reduce time to deploy from about 10 days to about 10 minutes.  This work allowed many teams to develop a culture of communication, trust and reliance on each other and the systems they all created collaboratively.  Finally, we will talk about how the engagement came to a conclusion.  We"ll discuss the things needed to "hand the keys over", which included a roadmap and training the existing staff.
