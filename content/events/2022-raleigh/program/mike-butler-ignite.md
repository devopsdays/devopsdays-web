I am proposing doing an Ignite talk on treating Everything As Code.  In 2019 I finally forced myself to use GitHub more as it was critical for my customers to also embrace DevOps and develop Chef Code (Infrastructure and Compliance as Code.) I wanted to be able to help them better understand some basic fundamentals of Development since many were coming from a purely Server / Application Operations culture and environment. I myself came from that Server Administrator culture and understood how difficult it can be for some folks to use GitHub (or any repository.) I made the decision one day to just treat _EVERYTHING_ as code. I started with our documentation in moving our customer facing and team documentation and created everything in markdown with Docusaurus to generate our webpage. For personal and day to day work I moved to using GitHub Issues in markdown and tracking work with Projects. I moved my daily notes from OneNote to a repo specific for my notes and everything in markdown.
