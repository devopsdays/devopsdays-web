I've been hacking on Linux related stuff since a certain operating system was released in 1998.  A seventeen year Red Hat veteran, currently supporting the container-runtimes team's  upstream CI automation with well oiled gears.  Primarily focused on upstream podman development CI automation, I generally hide from social-media since I highly value my few remaining brain-cells.
