Karen Taggart, Technical Product Owner at Liquibase, is a proud data and DevOps geek who advocates fiercely for continuous improvement, customer-centered strategy, open source software, and self-managing teams. Appreciative of transparency, sarcasm, and kindhearted people, she enjoys running, reading obsessively, fighting the patriarchy, and spending time with her adorable cyclops rescue dog.
