While running Kubernetes in the cloud offers many benefits, controlling the cost of your clusters can be challenging. By leveraging features of managed Kubernetes clusters such as Spot VM nodes and advanced autoscaling, costs can be reduced by over 80%, even for clusters with high resource utilization.

Yet, additional resiliency must be added for your applications to remain fully available during cluster scaling and node replacement cycles. A service mesh will add resiliency and help your keep your applications online while maximizing the cost reduction mechanisms for Kubernetes.

In this talk, you will learn how reducing costs by over 80% is possible using Istio service mesh running on Kubernetes in a major cloud provider.
