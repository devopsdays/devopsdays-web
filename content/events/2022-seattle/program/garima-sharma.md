My journey as a manager has been a roller coaster. It started as a lonely job till I figured out that it doesn’t need to be that way. Every report has a very different need and watching them achieve their goals is an amazing feeling. But, at the same time, receiving difficult feedback for another report and delivering them the same, causes stress and anxiety. In this talk I want to share 10 practices that I wish I knew before I became a manager. These practices helped me become an effective and productive manager, who isn’t stressed out or exhausted. Rather, becoming a manager who can build a transparent relationship with their team.
