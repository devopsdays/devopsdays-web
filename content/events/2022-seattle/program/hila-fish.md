Terraform is a GREAT tool, but like a lot of other things in life, it has its pitfalls and bad practices.

Since you are working with Terraform, you probably went through its documentation, which can tell you what resources can be used - BUT do you always have a clear path towards using these resources? How should modules be constructed? What should we call these modules? How should you structure your Terraform code in general?

In this talk, I’ll cover the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to Terraform. I will show best practices for working with Terraform that were put together with a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, so you’ll ultimately have a go-to approach and a paved way of working with Terraform, whether it’s an existing codebase or a new functionality altogether.
