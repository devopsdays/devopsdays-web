I have been attending CoffeeOps as often as possible for the past few years and I have grown to love it almost beyond words. And also, I have a lot of words to say on the matter. Research has shown that belonging to certain types of communities measurably improves one's subjective and objective well-being. As we all navigate a world full of unprecedented change and unpredictability and fear, and as we all battle anxiety and burnout in work and life, I want to share how CoffeeOps has helped me be resilient, and invite each person in the audience to find and join a community that grows and sustains them.
