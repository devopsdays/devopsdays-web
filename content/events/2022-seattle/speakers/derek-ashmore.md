I am currently the Application Transformation Practice Lead at Asperitas Consulting. I help companies leverage AWS and Azure cloud platforms to gain a competitive advantage. I focus on DevSecOps, infrastructure code, cloud computing, containerization, making applications cloud-native, and migrating applications to the cloud. I routinely speak at technical conferences such as DevOps West, DevNexus, the Chicago Cloud Conference, and many others. My books include the "The Java EE Architect's Handbook" and "Microservices for Java EE Architects".
