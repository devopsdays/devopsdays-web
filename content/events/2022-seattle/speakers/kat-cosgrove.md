Staff Developer Advocate at Pulumi

Kat Cosgrove is a Developer Advocate, a CNCF Ambassador, and an actual cyborg. Her professional background has run the gamut from bartender, to video store clerk, to teacher, to software engineer. She credits this wide-ranging experience for her success as a speaker, developer, and advocate. You can usually find her speaking about DevOps or cloud native technologies, particularly 101-level content, in pursuit of her goal of increasing accessibility for these tools.

When she's not building demos or at a conference, she spends her time playing video games, watching horror movies, and reading science fiction. She lives in Seattle with her cat, Espresso, who is the real brains behind the operation. Espresso may be ghostwriting her tweets.
