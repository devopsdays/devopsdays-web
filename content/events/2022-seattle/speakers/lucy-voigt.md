Hi! I'm Lucy, a software engineer at LaunchDarkly located in the Pacific Northwest. I'm passionate about writing tools for DevOps engineers, participating in Open Source and DevOps communities, and fostering inclusive team cultures.

In addition to my day job I lead the Portland CoffeeOps meetup (<https://www.meetup.com/Portland-DevOps-GroundUp>), have staffed the Seattle GNU/Linux conference (<https://seagl.org/>), was published in Increment (<https://increment.com/containers/docker-ce-and-ee/> <https://increment.com/open-source/community-service/>), and have spoken at a number of conferences.
