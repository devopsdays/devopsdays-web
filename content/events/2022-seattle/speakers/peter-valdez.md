Peter is an engineer, and co-founder of Shipyard (<https://shipyard.build>, development environments for devs, product, & QA). Born and raised in NYC, Peter has long been interested in tech at scale. He has learned a few things in his 14 years in the industry, and is always excited to share what cool things you can add to your .bash_profile or IDE to make the developer life that much easier. He also enjoys soundtracks by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, the occasional anime, and large-world sci-fi.
