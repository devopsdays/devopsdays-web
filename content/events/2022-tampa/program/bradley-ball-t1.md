Over the years I’ve faced some very difficult situations.  Almost getting walked out of the Office of the President of the United States and then given an award by the same individual that wanted me fired.  Talking to CIO’s about Azure Data Center outages and why they should still “trust” us, after the 2018 South Central DC outage when I was on the job 3 weeks.  Saving projects as a consultant by just using the word “Framework”.  Talking down angry customers, de-escalating tense situations, and focusing on the right outcomes.  There are a few key books that cover these concepts.  

In 15 minutes I will tell you what they are, why they are important, and how they saved me more than a few times.
