The beauty of a feature flag is simplicity - a conditional block of code that chooses between different execution paths at runtime. In this talk, we will combine this simple concept with DevOps and FeatureManagement to separate code deployments from feature releases, canary releases, & A/B testing.

The demos and code samples will use FeatureManagement (.NET Core, C#) and Azure App Configuration to show feature toggling, canary release and A/B Testing. Learn how to achieve control and mastery over your deployments and releases with feature flags.
