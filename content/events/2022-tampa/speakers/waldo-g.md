Waldo is a Tech Evangelist for Datadog, which normally means that he gets to travel and meet people, and advocate on their behalf. He is a recovering SRE and Operations Engineer, has been active in the DevOps community for quite some time, and is keen on helping organizations stop hurting themselves. Despite being a raging introvert, he enjoys public speaking. In his spare time, he enjoys collecting hobbies that he doesnâ€™t have the time to engage in. He hates writing about himself in the third person, and aspires to one day be a better bio writer.
