We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please checkout our <a href="https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2021/texas/devopsdays-texas-2021-prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a> or drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<hr>

devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not sell product presentations or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
<p>

#### Virtual Platform
Discord is our platform of choice for the virtual venue. It’s been used to host virtual DevOpsDays events including
DevOpsDays Chicago 2020. Discord provides several capabilities for virtual events including automated attendee
registration, breakout rooms with video, and private channels for coordination.
