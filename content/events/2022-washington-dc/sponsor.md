DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends on your sponsorships.
We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists.
Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event.
Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

The best thing to do is send practitioners to interact with their peers at DevOpsDays on their own terms. 

In 2019 we had 458 registered attendees and 91% showed up for at least a portion of the event. Of the attendees, 11% were government employees, the rest from a range of industries representing the diverse nature of the DC-Maryland-Virginia economy. DevOpsDays DC does not share registration information directly with sponsors, but feel free to ask attendees for their contact details. 

**Reserving and paying for your sponsorship**: Please use the PayPal links below, or email the organizers at {{< email_organizers >}} for alternate payment forms, or with any questions we can help you with.

The following chart outlines our paid sponsorship packages.

### Community Sponsorship

We are excited to offer community sponsorships. This is not a paid sponsorship. Instead, this sponsorship is extended to conferences, media and meetups who wish to exchange a spot on our banner for a spot on their own, and for cross-promotion on social media. Building community in the area is a worthwhile goal and we're all in this together! Community sponsors must be:
* Part of the mission to help promote technology and/or technology education in DC, Maryland and Virginia, OR
  * A not-for-profit organization in the DevOps space that shares the above interests & values
* Willing to help promote, in kind, DevOpsDays DC.
* Willing to adhere to our code of conduct

Sponsors are granted one comp ticket, a discount code to promote within their community, Twitter and LinkedIn mentions, and your icon on our website and slides.

We reserve the right to limit the number of community and media sponsorships. Please reach out to {{< email_organizers >}} to set up this relationship.
