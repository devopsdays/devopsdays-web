DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends on your sponsorships.
We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists.
Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event.
Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.

The best thing to do is send practitioners to interact with their peers at DevOpsDays on their own terms. 

In 2019 we had 458 registered attendees and 91% showed up for at least a portion of the event. Of the attendees, 11% were government employees, the rest from a range of industries representing the diverse nature of the DC-Maryland-Virginia economy. DevOpsDays DC does not share registration information directly with sponsors, but feel free to ask attendees for their contact details. 

Please email the organizers at {{< email_organizers >}} for information on **reserving and paying for your sponsorship**, or for any questions you may have.

The following chart outlines our sponsorship packages.
