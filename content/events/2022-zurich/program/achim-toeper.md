### Ignite

Last year, we talked about putting humanity on the moon and listed the top 10 SAP DevOps songs. But it's not enough to reach the moon. Humanity is dreaming of reaching and taking over Mars. These far-reaching and compelling missions take special female and male leaders, like Commander Peggy Whitson and Chris Hadfield. Chris Hadfield was the first to perform the David Bowie song "Space Oddity" live on the ISS, and Peggy Whitson held the record for the most spacewalks by a woman. Chris Hadfield became famous for, among other things, a quote after using a Swiss Army knife in space: "We experienced the true space age: we broke into Mir with a Swiss Army knife."

NASA doesn't just talk about DevOps, it acts on it. With different nations and international partners (e.g. SpaceX), you work together and pursue the common goal. SAP projects are very similar: big goals, often international teams. In collaboration and communication, "DevOps for SAP" shows amazing results. The leadership styles of some well-known and fictional heroes from outer space will teach us the earthly skills needed to successfully implement DevOps for SAP!

In my Ignite session, let's experience together how the leadership skills of the heroes from outer space adapted to everyday life will ensure your personal success, not only in SAP projects.
