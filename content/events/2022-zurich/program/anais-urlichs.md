### Talk

When we are talking about DevSecOps, we often focus on Security for Developers or Security for workload management and deployments. While the discussion between DevOps and SRE continues until the end of time, we can agree that SRE is more focused on the culture and the processes put in place to build reliable and efficient infrastructure for our deployments. If we just adapt security tools into our SRE workflows, we might risk introducing decoupled processes.

This talk will showcase how we can integrate open source security solutions and a security-centric mindset into the SRE culture. Anais Urlichs will first provide an overview of the top security risks that we face during our cloud native infrastructure management and deployments; and then highlight how we may adapt our workflows to become security-centric.
