### Ignite

Let us shed some light on the famous and notorious Minimum Viable Product.

Build-Measure-Learn, the Lean Startup Cycle, which made the MVP famous, has some parallels to the DevOps Cycle.

So can thinking about MVP help you in planning what to do next in DevOps, too? And can DevOps help you in applying the MVP pattern?

Yes. As long as we keep some important aspects in mind.

In this - slightly different - Ignite Iâ€™ll share my thoughts on what the motives were behind the invention of MVP, what it is not and what you have to pay attention on while operating with this concept.
