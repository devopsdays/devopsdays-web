### Keynote
A chasm is opening up between elite, high-performing teams, and the rest of us. According to the DORA report, elite teams get code to users 25,000x faster than the bottom half of teams, deploy 46x more frequently, and restore service from incidents in 2666x less time ... and while the same resources are theoretically available to all teams, the performance gap is actually widening with each year. WTF Is going on? Are the majority of teams just doomed to mediocrity? Is this a skill gap (spoiler: no), a technical problem, or a business one? Most importantly, how can you help your team function at an elite level? Let's talk through the social and technical strategies that great teams all of the world are using to be happier and more productive...and make their users happy too.
