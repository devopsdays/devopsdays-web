### Ignite

With the growing cloud adoption, we constantly find new roles in the market that didn’t exist a short time ago: “Cloud Native engineers”, “Cloud Architects”, etc. Where do suitable candidates come from?
My answer: people evolve into those new roles. For companies it’s faster to find people with the right (but not necessarily perfect) combination of the required skills and the right mindset in this way than trying to find someone filling in all new job requirements. For us, employees, it’s a chance to grow and take on new professional challenges, which is usually combined with a boost on the motivation (and on the salary!)
Stepping into the unknown requires courage. I went through this adventure between 2019 and 2021 when I joined a cloud-migration project as an engineer in a platform team coming from a system analyst role in a product team. The technological learning curve was very steep and difficult, but other kind of skills were my key to tackle the challenge and not to lose sanity in the way.
In this talk I will take the audience in a journey from catching the opportunity, starting in the new role, growing into it and learning to be prepared for whatever is coming next. I will provide tips on how to improve our self-confidence, self-awareness, adaptability and effective learning through storytelling with daily-work examples that anyone can hopefully use whenever it’s time to step out of the comfort zone and grow into any new role, even beyond the cloud.
