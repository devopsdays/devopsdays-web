### Talk

Automated security testing has elegantly addressed many cybersecurity concerns in modern software development. Besides incorporating security gates in CI/CD pipelines, however, there are additional measures to ensure that our innovation can withstand the growing threat landscape. In this talk, we will share our experiences in applying critical security best practices that help protect your customersâ€™ data and ensure business continuity. We put these security practices in the context of relevant industry standards to show a holistic view of a mature security development lifecycle.
