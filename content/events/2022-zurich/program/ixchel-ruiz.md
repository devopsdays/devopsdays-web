### Ignite

Documentation is an integral part of our life as developers and rarely is an activity regarded as enjoyable.
One of the many challenges is to deliver documents to different audiences and formats while taking into consideration data structuring, discoverability and navigability.
The Asciidoc format offers solutions to these challenges, firstly and foremost because it will remain close to the source so keeping in sync may be easier, second and the most compelling reason is it allows creating various types of documents from the same source by using variables, conditionals and macros!
