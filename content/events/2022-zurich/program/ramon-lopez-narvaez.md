### Talk

At Amazon we live by the mantra of "You build it, you run it". In this talk we'll explore how Amazon teams organize themselves and how they build, measure, test, deploy and monitor modern web applications. The talk not only covers technical aspects but also mechanisms, processes and cultural pillars that make a true end-to-end DevOps workflow possible.
