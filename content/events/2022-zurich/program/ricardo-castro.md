### Workshop

Cloud native is a modern approach to building, running, and managing services. Cloud native systems aim to achieve rapid change, large scale, and reliability. To achieve this, several modern technologies and practices, like microservices, containers, CI/CD, or DevOps, are paramount.

Containers and Kubernetes have revolutionized how we build, run and manage applications. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to containerize an application and how to deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster. Along the way you’ll learn how to work with Dockerfiles, Kubernetes concepts like Pods and Services, what Helm is and how to launch a Kubernetes cluster locally for development and testing purposes.
