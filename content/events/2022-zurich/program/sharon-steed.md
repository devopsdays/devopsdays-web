### Talk

Empathy is a core component of teamwork. In order to create inclusive cultures that can sustain diversity, you must make a sincere effort to understand those around you and know how to effectively communicate with them in order to be achieve great things. That perspective garnered from taking the time to understand others highly correlates with success. But what if you don’t know where you’re succeeding when engaging empathy and where you need a bit of help? If you’re not sure the exact ways to communicate with empathy and feel more connected to those on your team? Or when you’ve nailed how to truly garner perspective, you’re not sure how to make those behaviors endure for the long haul?

This talk breaks down the process to make the changes necessary to better engage empathy. We’ll determine how to identify the gaps you or your team may have when creating inclusive experiences for your team; discuss how to lay a foundation for implementation for those changes; and build an accountability model so we can sustain those changes.
