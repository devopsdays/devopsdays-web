### Ignite

Not sure what your role is: Maybe you are called a Full Stack Developer, Site Reliability Manager, DevOps Engineer or something else. Whatever your role or title might be - we live in an ever changing world and there are specific skills which have nothing to do with your technical role, but will make the difference between "ordinary" or "extraordinary". If you will not master them, you put additional hurdles in your own way to unleash your full future potential and success. Many people focus on technical skills and certifications but forget some other essential skills that are as important. In this session you will see what skills are meant and why they will become more and more important in the near future. You will learn where you need to focus, so you can make sure you will not miss any opportunity and make the most out of your career - independent of the technology you work with.
