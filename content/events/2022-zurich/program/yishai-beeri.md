### Ignite

Accelerate popularized “DORA 4” metrics for tracking the health of your dev pipeline. I studied 2,600 teams and found a single indicator that predicts if your team’s metrics will be elite. Learn why small PR size is the key to healthy cycle time, MTTR, change failure rate and deploy frequency.

This presentation includes industry benchmarks from 2,600 dev teams collected from January 2020 though June 2021, all of the data and citations from my research, multiple case studies from well known Israeli start-ups like Unbabel, Intsights and BigID and tips for improving PR size, cycle time, MTTR, change failure rate and deployment frequency.
