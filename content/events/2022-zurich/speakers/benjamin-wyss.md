### Requirements Engineer & Product Owner @ Infometis AG
Benjamin Wyss gained his first experience in business analysis over 15 years ago following his apprenticeship in banking. He quickly learned that a wide variety of stakeholders have requirements for IT systems and that these are rarely congruent.
He got to know the agile world in practice during his several years as a product owner for social insurance software and came to appreciate it to a high degree. He is particularly convinced by the transparent communication as well as the constant reflection and improvement. Today, he works as a project member and consultant in various areas as a requirements engineer, product owner, agile coach and lecturer.
