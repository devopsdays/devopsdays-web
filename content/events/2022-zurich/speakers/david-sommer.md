### Lead Security Consultant @ Zühlke Engineering AG

"Security is a design principle!" This is my conclusion after being involved in secure software development since my teens, while financing studying Physics as a security analyst, and finally receiving a PhD in Security and Privacy from ETH Zurich. Now, I follow my passion at Zühlke and try to make the digital world a more secure place. With expertise in designing and establishing secure protocols, the most fun part of my job is breaking these and improving business processes with the won experiences.
