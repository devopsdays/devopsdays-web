### Project Manager @ Noser Engineering AG
Oliver is a person with great passion for transformation and change. With a background in industrial engineering, he has vast experience in project and project portfolio management across multifunctional, global, and multicultural teams. While pursuing his studies, Oliver started his career in the aviation industry, with a ground handling provider, where he worked his way up from entry-level frontline staff to corporate management. In October 2021, after 10 years, he swapped roles â€“ from the customer receiving technologies to an engineering service provider.
Like turning limited and random ingredients from the fridge into a divine meal, Oliver likes to think pragmatically and outside-the-box to achieve best business outcome under given circumstances.
