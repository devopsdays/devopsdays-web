### DevOps Solutions Developer @ DVT
I'm a DevOps solutions developer from South Africa - previously a full stack engineer but now specializing in DevOps (engineering and leadership).

I feel my experience and history places me in that category of "ops-savvy" developers, and I'm quite inspired by how much this community has managed to accomplish in a short space of time.

Outside of work I'm quite a music/film nerd, and I love soccer and play it casually. I'm a huge FC Barcelona fanboy and my dream is to one day be able to watch a game live at the Camp Nou.
