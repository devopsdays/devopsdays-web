As companies grow, they face the challenge of balancing security and developer experience (DX) while building platforms. There is often a conflict of priorities between developers and security. While platform engineers focus on building a secure foundation for future work, product engineers are closer to customer-facing deadlines and feel the need to cut corners on things like testing and security to meet deadlines. This can negatively impact the application, platform or business security.

We will look at how modern security teams implement a culture of a continuous approach to security, integrate with development, and achieve better results than traditional methods.

Striking a balance between engineering and security requirements is crucial to the long-term viability of a software product, and everyone should work together to achieve this balance.
