[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome): "Shiny object syndrome is the situation where people focus undue attention on an idea that is new and trendy, yet drop this as soon as something new takes its place."

I battle(d) with it all the time when first entering the cloud-native ecosystem and struggled a lot, being disappointed in myself and frustrated with the little progress I made.

Over time, I managed to turn the situation around and capitalize on SOS by finding a more focused, disciplined, and organized approach.

In this ignite, I will share my experiences, perspective, and steps to mitigate 'tool fatigue' caused by SOS.
