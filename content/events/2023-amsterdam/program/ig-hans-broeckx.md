The idea started with a certain Mr. Buytaert overhearing my conversation with a certain Ms. Drees about chickens. The original pitch was "Being oncall is like raising chickens", but I'm not sure if I can conjure up enough links between those two. So I ended up with "Developing a pipeline is like raising chickens", which can absolutely draw enough lines. This talk is meant to serve as a lightweight "snack" between talks and to wet my toes at giving talks.

PS: This talk does not shy away from (ab)using pictures of chicken enthusiasts.
