Does your organization aim to increase productivity, decrease time to market and become more efficient? Then you need engineers with the right skills to improve productivity and strengthen the engineering culture. However, it can be difficult to find experienced engineers to fill the gaps. Over the past few years, we at ING have found that hiring (external) trainees with little to no IT experience and investing in their development is a great way of meeting our talent needs.

During this talk, attendees will learn (from a former trainee!) about the benefits we have experienced of hiring trainees. They will discover why investing in the development of these new workers can also help their organization to:

1.	Meet their talent needs: by hiring trainees, organizations can build their own talent pipeline and reduce their reliance on external sources. This can help ensure they have the right people in place to meet their current and future needs. 

2.	Foster innovation: IT trainees bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the workplace. By investing in their development, teams can create a culture of innovation that drives growth and success.

3.	Develop a positive, learning-oriented culture: Hiring IT trainees and investing in their development can create a positive culture that attracts other skilled workers. This can help to build a high-performing and productive technology team that drives business success. We’ve found that our trainees are energetic, motivated, and eager to grow and improve. This in turn has a positive impact on the culture in our teams.

This session is for you if:
-	You’re interested in learning more about the advantages of hiring trainees
-	Your team has had vacancies open for months and you’re open to new solutions
-	You have some doubts, concerns, or questions about hiring trainees that you would like to see addressed by someone with practical experience
