As our work continues to grow more demanding, burnout and work-related mental health problems increase as well. It might surprise you to learn how Ivan has successfully fought the negative effects of work stress: volunteering. In this talk, Ivan will recount his experience building a Kickstarter-like platform for a Bulgarian NPO. He'll share lessons he learned, how he improved his emotional well-being, and misconceptions about getting involved with open source projects.
