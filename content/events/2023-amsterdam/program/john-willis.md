Since the DevOps Handbook was first published in 2013, I have been researching Dr. Edwards Deming’s impact on everything DevOps. In 2018, Gene Kim and I published a book called Beyond the Phoenix Project, in which I discussed Dr. Deming’s influence on Agile, Lean, DevOps, and DevSecOps. My latest book, Deming’s Journey to Profound Knowledge, will be published by IT Revolution in August 2023. DevOps and DevSecOps have incorporated many of Deming’s ideas, but many of Deming’s theories on quality still need to be addressed. I propose that Dr. Deming would see quality as the overarching topic for IT security, governance, and risk, currently referred to as Governance Engineering. In this presentation, I will illustrate how Pareto Analysis can analyze the Secure Control Framework’s 285 security domains and 1169 risk controls. As a result, 80 percent of frameworks include the top 20 risk controls. We will also examine Dr. Deming’s theories and how they could apply to cyber threats, risk controls, and general governance principles.
