Dr. Deming used the Red Bead Experiment to illustrate several points about poor management practices. Among the lessons from the Red Bead Experiment is that management is more about means and methods than results, and the system bounds workers they work with. Dr. Deming believed ratings, promotions, and bonuses must be based on systems thinking approach to avoid unintended consequences. By incorporating OKRs and systems thinking, John has modernized the game. Five participants (willing workers) will participate in the game, and the audience will be consultants. Rewards, signed books, will be given to willing workers who produce the fewest defects. In addition to being incredibly informative, the game is also quite entertaining.
