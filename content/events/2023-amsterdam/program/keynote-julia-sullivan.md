It's time to rethink the imposter syndrome, urges Julia Sullivan, author of Geeks Guide To Work*, because it has wrongly been given a bad name.  

These days it's common to talk about the fear of not keeping up or living up to expectations as if it is a stressful and lonely condition we need to be cured of. But when we admit that fear and uncertainty are at the very core of being a human being we can use them as a powerful source to move and excite us and create strong and meaningful connections with others.     

In a light-hearted journey through popular and less popular culture, Julia examines the thinking flaws that lead us into self doubt and loneliness. While most people spend years studying “hard” skills, Julia shows that the key to a successful, happy and fulfilled life lies in learning how to get better at maintain nourishing and resilient relationships. Above all with ourselves.
