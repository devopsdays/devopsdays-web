At Cloudflare, we use Prometheus heavily. We have point of presence (POP) in more than 285+ number of cities and each POP have their own Prometheis. All these Prometheis send alerts to a central Alertmanager. We have various integrations to route the alerts. We also route all the alerts to a datastore for alert analytics.
