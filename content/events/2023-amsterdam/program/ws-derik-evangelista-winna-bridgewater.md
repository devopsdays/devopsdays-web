Multi-cluster topologies are a key part of Kubernetes. Organisations gain many benefits using multiple clusters, such as increased scale, bespoke APIs, blast radius reduction and more. However, multi-cluster deployments also increase complexity.

With multiple clusters comes increased building and maintenance complexity for the platform team. Answers to questions like which cluster to install certain tools into, how to provision newly created clusters in a standard way, and whether to provide ephemeral cluster environments, are becoming more important. These answers often come with a whole host of technologies as baggage.

This workshop will explore how to use a higher level framework to encapsulate your platform offerings. And with these now packaged offerings, you can automate their availability according to business requirements across both existing and future clusters to build a powerful platform that supports engineering productivity and business requirements.
