Title = "Practical Guide to Distributed Tracing with Jaeger"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["dotan-horovits"]

The dynamic and highly distributed nature of modern systems renders it impossible to keep track of the web of interconnecting services and of the flow of requests through that web. Distributed tracing provides the missing telemetry to understand the service dependencies in a microservice (or any highly distributed) system and identify critical paths and latency sources in the application.

Distributed tracing has been gaining a lot of attention, with 38% percent increase in DevOps using it year over year. The leading tool in that space is Jaeger, the popular open source project which was developed at Uber, and is now a graduated project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

This workshop will introduce basic concepts and terms such as code instrumentation, spans and sampling rates. Then through live demo on Jaeger you will learn how to effectively use it to monitor your microservices architecture.

This is a practical and fun workshop, that will give you the feel of distributed tracing and how it can help you to troubleshoot performance issues in production, using the popular Jaeger OSS.
