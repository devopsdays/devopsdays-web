Keeping up with everything you’re “supposed” to know in tech can be exhausting. In this workshop we’ll explore some of the concrete fundamental concepts of how we learn, before looking at some great, flexible ways to plan how you’re going to approach your learning. We’ll cover some key concepts relevant to beginner technologists, before moving on to look at how developers further in their career can continue their learning journey. We’ll include a number of concrete tips designed to address a range of learning styles. At the end of this workshop you should have templates for how you might want to plan your learning moving forward, as well as the foundational knowledge needed to make the most of your learning sessions.
