In this workshop we will dive into one of the most broadly adopted software engineering practices - peer code review.

Following a brief motivation why do we need code reviews in the first place, Luben will present his set of best practices for both the reviewer and the reviewee.

After that we will discuss some common pitfalls and techniques how to avoid them. At the very end we will perform two live code reviews and see how the presented ideas can be applied in practice.

There will be breaks for Q&A and room-discussions throughout the workshop.
