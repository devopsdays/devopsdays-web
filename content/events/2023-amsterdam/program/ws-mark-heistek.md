Resistance is everywhere. It's within your team, it's with your manager, it's within your relationship, and everywhere you look, there's always some kind of resistance.
Now, this isn't perse a bad thing, resistance is just one phase of change. Insecurity, resistance, anger, joy, and happiness are all part of the change. 
It just depends on where someone is in that change process and that will determine the emotion.

We've created a serious game that lets you experience the different phases of change.  To go from a fixed mindset (resistance) to a growth mindset (motivated and joyful) in less than an hour.
And we'll also give you some background theory about the different phases of resistance.
