Carlos is an automation junkie. A nerd and a hobbyist at heart.
He wrote his first website when he was 6 years old on his uncle's computer using Office Word.
Since then, his passion for computers hasn't stopped.

When he's not busy helping customers with cloud migration projects or automation challenges or speaking at conferences, he's somewhere in the mountains paragliding.

He values open communication, clean code, emotional maturity and nerd talk.
