Christoph Hartmann, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Mondoo, wants to make the world more secure.
Christophâ€™s cloud security experience began 15 years ago at Deutsche Telekom. He secured critical infrastructure at scale and co-developed the widely adopted open source security project dev-sec.io.
Building on this experience, he co-founded Vulcano Security and initiated the open source project InSpec, which helps Fortune 100 companies automate compliance assessments for Linux and Windows. Vulcano Security was quickly acquired by DevOps automation leader Chef Software. Christoph served as Engineering Director at Chef and was responsible for globally scaling the compliance engineering team.
