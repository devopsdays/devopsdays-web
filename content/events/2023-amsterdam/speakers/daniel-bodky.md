Daniel is a consultant at NETWAYS Professional Services and is fond of all things cloud-native. His duties comprise client work including Kubernetes, Prometheus, and GitLab. Since the start of 2022, Daniel has been looking into cloud-native technologies, mainly Kubernetes and its vast ecosystem of tools, and became CKA certified in the process.

After attending KubeCon EU 2022, he now wants to switch from the visitor’s to the speaker’s perspective in 2023.

When Daniel is not trying out new frameworks and tools, he enjoys coding on some pet projects, mainly in Python and Rust.
