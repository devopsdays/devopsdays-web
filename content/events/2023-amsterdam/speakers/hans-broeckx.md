Thirty-something systems administrator from Belgium with blue eyes, black hair and a bushy beard.

My job is to make some IT magic happen at Inuits, a group of Open Source enthusiasts providing digital solutions for clients in all sectors.

I love exploring the world, learning new things, and enjoying life in general. I have a loving family and some amazing friends that help me to achieve my dreams.
