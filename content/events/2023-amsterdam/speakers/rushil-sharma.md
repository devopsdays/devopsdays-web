I am Rushil and I love video games :D movies and science fiction a lot, and one of the many reasons why I love technology so much. I have been working in tech for over a decade and have previously worked at Red Hat, Emirated National Bank of Dubai and now with Google Brussels for 2 years now. 

I work primarily in Application Modernisation and consult our customers in the Benelux on anything and everything in and around GKE and serverless. I love public speaking a lot and I am delivering a lot of SRE sessions over the last 1 year in this region and have had an amazing feedback from the auidences and would the audience to attend my workshop at the DevOps days Amsterdam.
