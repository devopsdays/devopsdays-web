Winna is a Principal Engineer at Syntasso delivering Kratix, an open-source framework for building internal platforms on Kubernetes. She’s using what she learned about how teams work from her years of teaching extreme programming and pairing with customer application development teams at places like Fortnum & Mason, BMW, Allianz, Sainsbury’s, and others. She’s using what she learned about how platforms work from her years as an engineer and in engineering leadership with CloudFoundry. And before all of that, she came to tech via design and user research. She’s happy that she can wear all the different hats her experience has given her to help build a first-class tool that enables platform teams to deliver high value and enjoy their work in the process. Outside of work, Winna mostly tries to keep up with her two young girls whilst maintaining her sanity.
