Customer experience is the responsibility of the entire team. Many organizations leave reliability up to the SRE team, however reliability should be built in from the very beginning. In this talk, We will discuss what Service Levels Objectives are, why they are important to the organization, and how to define and set them. Going beyond SLOs, attendees will learn what Chaos Engineering is and practical ways to ensure compliance and resilience with best practices. Weâ€™ll show you how to focus your goals and error budgets with examples that will lead to reliability and improved user experience.
