In a company, department, or team, we will often talk about “strategy”.  This term is rarely well defined, or at least not defined in a way that is useful.  It usually means that we need to see into the future to outmaneuver our competition, or at least to navigate a changing market and competitive landscape.  Traditional tools are limited in their ability to help us which led Simon Wardley to create maps that have helped him (and now others) to understand the current landscape as well as see common patterns that can allow you to “predict the future”.

In this session, Mike introduces Wardley Maps, the different ways they can be used for understanding the strategic landscape, and aid in strategic decision making.
