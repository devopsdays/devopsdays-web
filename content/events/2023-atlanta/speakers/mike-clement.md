I believe we work best when we are working together collaboratively and that there are no best practices—only better and worse ones depending on the context. Some leading practices I’m passionate about are Test Driven Development, Pair and Mob Programming, User Story Mapping, Assumptions Mapping, Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Architecture, EventStorming, Training from the Back of the Room, Lean Coffee, and Open Space Technology.
