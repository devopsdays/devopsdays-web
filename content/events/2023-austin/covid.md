### COVID Policy

All attendees, sponsors, and everyone on site must:

* Wear a mask/face covering
* Show proof of a negative COVID test within 72 hours of the event **OR** show proof of at least 2 COVID vaccine shots with the last dose performed at least two weeks prior to the event

We ask that anyone sick with COVID or with recent exposure to COVID-positive individuals not attend. Should DevOpsDays Austin 2023 be cancelled due to COVID, we will not move to an online format. This policy is subject to change up to and including during the conference. However, no relaxation of the policy will be implemented within 30 days of the event. 

Please direct questions or concerns by email to: **{{< email_organizers >}}**.

### FAQ

##### Where do masks need to be worn? 

Indoors. Masks are optional outdoors and may be removed while eating.

##### Will speakers have to wear masks during their talk?

No, it is optional for the active speaker.

##### How will you be verifying tests and vaccines? Is a certain kind of test or vaccine OK?

We will not be verifying testing or vaccines on site, you are on your honor per our Code of Conduct. Home tests are fine.

##### Will volunteers be having to enforce vaccinations and masking?

As a volunteer, you will not have to ask about vaccinations or testing; we will remind people at checkin of the requirement but are not verifying it. If someone isn't wearing a mask either upon entry or later during the conference, please remind them and offer one of our free masks we'll have on hand. If they refuse or are argumentative just go find an organizer, we will involve the venue and have them ejected, ain't nobody got time for that.
