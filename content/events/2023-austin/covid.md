### COVID Policy

We wanted to make you aware that we are changing our Health and Safety policies for the event starting 4 May 2023. Masks are still strongly encouraged, but now we will not be enforcing masking at DevOpsDays Austin 2023. We still expect people to either be up to date on their vaccinations for COVID-19 or have tested negative within 72 hours of the event, though. We will also trust in each others' commitment to the health of our community, and we will not be checking test results or vaccination cards at registration.

To make it clear that we want people to feel comfortable coming either with or without a mask, we consider any form of harassment, including commentary, about someone else's masking decision to be a violation of the Code of Conduct, and we reserve the right to act on any violation up to and including expelling the offender from the conference immediately.

Please direct questions or concerns by email to: **{{< email_organizers >}}**.
