“Digital twin” is a trending buzzword at large industrial companies. But what is it? Through a concrete, small-scale application, you will learn how you can — but probably shouldn’t — build digital twins around your home.

1. A refresher on what a digital twin is.
2. What deploying a digital twin entails
    1. Gathering data from the real world with sensors
    2. Building a 3D model of the physical system you are creating a twin of
    3. Connecting the data to the 3D model in near real time to inform the users
    4. Maybe adding a little bit of *Machine Learning* or *simulation* (or just plain logic!) to the mix in order to do help the user make decisions, trigger alarms or suggest predictive maintenance operations.
3. Let's solve a problem **all** of us in the room have one day or another.
After a while, all doors start creaking. What if you could get a reminder to lubricate the hinges when the time is right? That would be a life-changing feature, right? Let's go down the steps presented before and see how, in just a few hours, you can build a digital twin of a door in your house
    1. Gathering data from the real world using a Raspberry Pi
    2. Finding a relevant and free 3D model on Sketchfab
    3. Building a production-ready deployment of your digital twin in a couple minutes with AWS IoT TwinMaker.
    4. Teaching the Digital Twin when to let you know that it's time to get that lubricant spray.
