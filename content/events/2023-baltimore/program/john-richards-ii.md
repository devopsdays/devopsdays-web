Enterprises have implemented many security products in their environments, but they still face a challenge: ensuring the effectiveness of these platforms in reducing or eliminating risks. To address this, let's define "security efficacy" as the ability to produce a desired result.

Many digital transformation initiatives today involve a strategic move to the cloud. As a result, a new security paradigm emerges when enterprises need more visibility into applications and data, need help identifying and securing cloud assets, and grapple with defining a new governance and compliance model.

While cloud service providers are responsible for the security "of" the cloud, enterprises are tasked with security "in" the cloud. This includes securing a complex set of cloud services, configurations, data integrity, and identity and access controls.

To address these challenges, enterprises must develop a holistic approach to cloud security. This involves defining a new perimeter for cyber assets and overlaying a security posture for cloud governance.

Modern cyber asset surface management solutions provide visibility and context for an organization's digital assets running in the cloud. Security posture management ensures cyber assets are protected by security policies that automatically check these assets and resources, identify security risks and policy violations, and drive workflow and remediation.

A successful transition to the cloud requires enterprises to adopt a new security framework and modern cloud security platforms to protect their applications and data.
