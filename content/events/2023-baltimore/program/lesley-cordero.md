This talk focuses on how to use principles & practices from DevOps to create a culture of excellence and psychological safety on Product Engineering teams. We will cover practices like how to use & define SLOs, create feedback loops to prioritize high-impact work, & get buy-in from key stakeholders.

In this talk, we'll be diving into the intersection between product engineering and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). We'll explore how they're combined to create a culture of excellence and psychological safety, both within a team and across an entire organization.

We'll start by discussing the fundamentals of DevOps and SRE, and then we'll explore how product engineers can use these principles and practices to develop more reliable, scalable, and resilient systems. We'll cover topics such as Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and how to define and use them effectively to manage expectations and prioritize high-impact work.

We'll also touch on how to create feedback loops to continuously improve the quality and performance of your products, and how to get buy-in from key stakeholders. Ultimately, you'll leave this talk with a deeper understanding of how to foster a culture of excellence, accountability, and psychological safety in your product engineering teams, and drive better outcomes for your organization as a whole.
