Managing Infrastructure as code is one of the pillars on the road to full automation of apps&infrastructure. DevOps teams need to automate to highest level. I tell about how to do this using cloudnative tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, and cloud native pipelines using Jenkins(X), Tekton.

This session handles about Infrastructure As Code, in terms of how this fits into the Cloud  Infrastructure, using tools as Terraform and how build a pipeline with Jenkins and Git.It elaborates about cloudnative tooling to accomplish an automation level of rolling out infrastructure along with application CI CD pipelines. Some of these cloudnative tools are discussed about how they fit into a Cloud environment, rolling out A managed Kubernetes Engine, Appservers, bastion hosts and so on. It is also a good starting point for newcomers, who aren't familiar with all these buzzwords and new technologies, methods, to get a first glimpse what they might expect. Especially if they are used to the tradional way of rolling out, they can gain new insights of how they can innovate in this area.
