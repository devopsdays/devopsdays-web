Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["mike-lanciano"]

+++

Boundaries are dead and we are transforming the way we work. Zero trust architectures are here and they impact the way we build and deliver capability.  Understand the basics ZTA and what it means for your organization.

As companies continue to normalize remote work and we see an increase in the attacks on the critical CI/CD pipelines that are the cornerstone of DevOps culture, we will discuss how zero trust architectures are changing the perimeter discussion of our automation and infrastructure.  The talk will cover the basic principles of zero trust, a practical look at how it protects all stages of development and delivery, and the challenges of its complexity in practice.
