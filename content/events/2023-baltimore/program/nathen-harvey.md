Technology drives value and innovation in every organization. At Google Cloud, we have learned a lot about what it takes to build and scale high-performing technology teams. Our own lived experience combined with a multi-year research program led by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team can be used to help you and your team transform into a high-performing technology team.

This talk will dive into some of the findings of the 2022 DORA research program.
