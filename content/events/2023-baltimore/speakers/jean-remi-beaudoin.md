JR (short for Jean-Rémi) is the CTO of Theodo in New York, a software consultancy. He moved to the US in 2018 after living in London for 2 years but is originally from France.
When he isn't setting up (serverless) software architectures or coding user interfaces for his clients, he enjoys exploring the US with his family.
