My talk will delve into my journey of evolving a Birmingham startup’s mobile app from the time the company was making a little over $1M ARR to growing to over $50M ARR and all the challenges that have accompanied it. At a high level my talk will discuss a successful full rewrite from Ionic to native Swift and Kotlin, continuously shipping weekly releases by adopting Spotify’s “Release Train” model, and leveling up our CI/CD pipeline using fastlane and CircleCI. I hope to share both technical and process advancements that have changed the game for us at Fleetio and allowed us to consistently ship high quality releases on a weekly cadence.
