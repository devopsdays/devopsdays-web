The industry as a whole is learning about what it means to be a platform engineer. With this talk I will share my team’s real world story of what it is like to be a platform team. It may be surprising to some that, for a smaller engineering organization, platform engineering is not about “building an internal heroku”. It is about solving specific problems developers have and helping them improve their delivery velocity and application reliability. Through a series of anecdotes from my past year on this team I will share my distilled learnings and paint a clearer picture of what platform teams do day-to-day.
