At Tilled we believe we have built a maintainable, scalable, observable system that other organizations could benefit. With a team of 2 we have accomplished a lot with a little around CICD, SRE, devops, devx and we would like to share that recipe. Its a homemade pizza because we are small but it can be just as tasty as anything ordered out or bought from a store.
