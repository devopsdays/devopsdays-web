JJ will walk you through deploying a simple python application to Kubernetes/OpenShift. We’ll start from the ground up, then get a complete automated build. The goal is to enable your developers to focus on code, not the infrastructure! It’s a chance to see the power of OpenShift and why taking the time to learn cloud-native development can get you the velocity you need.
