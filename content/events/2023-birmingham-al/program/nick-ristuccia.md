Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars space laser program impacts your smart fridge. A war in Eastern Europe may necessitate the rise of AI farming. How are these things possible? And how can you, as a developer, get the most out of future Internet of Things (IoT) work? This talk explores the fascinating history, geopolitics, and architecture that shape modern day edge computing and IoT development. We’ll also look at requirements for projects and gadgets in this environment. This includes tools to perform over-the-air software updates to a fleet of connected devices and to monitor the health of devices. Manual updates, by comparison, are difficult because of the sheer number of devices in a fleet and their often hard-to-reach locations. This is where DevOps meets IoT.
