Istio is the most widely used service mesh platform in the world. In September 2022, Google and Solo.io announced the release of Istio Ambient Mesh to the community. Ambient offers a revolutionary data-plane architecture that allows service mesh users to ditch sidecars. It slashes operational complexity and enables incremental mesh adoption, all while reducing cost and computational overhead within a service mesh. 

This interactive workshop provides a hands-on tour of the new Ambient capabilities, including:
• Mesh on-boarding without sidecars
• Layer 4-7 authorization policies
• Layer 7 observability
• Fault injection
• Traffic shifting

Each session participant will have access to their own sandboxed Kubernetes environment hosted on the Instruqt platform. A Solo-sponsored, Credly-managed "Foundation for Ambient Mesh" badge will be issued to workshop participants who choose to take and pass a free certification exam offered at the end of the session.
