Chad McElligott is currently a Staff Infrastructure Engineer at Sotheby’s, working on the auction platform. He has worked as a full-stack software engineer most of his career in sectors such as medical, telecommunications, and back office business systems. He is a long-time DevOps advocate, driving infrastructure-as-code initiatives, cloud adoption, and cross-silo collaboration for as long as he can remember. When he’s not hacking at work or on side projects, he loves going on hikes with his wife Elizabeth, his 8-year old daughter Avery and his dog Hudson.
