Nick Hodges is the Developer Advocate for Passage and has been in love with code since he wrote crude text-based adventure games in BASIC using paper tape and a TTY Model 33. Nick really got going with software development when he picked up a copy of Turbo Pascal for Windows and followed that on with Delphi. Currently Nick is interested in Typescript and Angular development. He's a passionate Minnesota sports fan -- especially the Timberwolves -- as he grew up and went to college in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. He currently lives in West Chester, PA.
