<h1> Covid Precautions </h1>

DevOps Days Birmingham Conference is an inclusive event to celebrate and explore the great technical talent across the region, so we don’t want you spending the day anxious about covid, we want you to be having fun!
To ensure the event is as safe as possible for all in attendance we are taking the following precautions and ask that you help us by cooperating with them.

<h2>On arrival at the event </h2>

<b>When you arrive we will do the following: </b>

<h3>Check your temperature</h3> 

We will do this by using a “thermometer gun,” a device that is equipped with an infrared sensor that can quickly measure surface temperature without making any contact with a person's skin.

<h3>Ask you to provide proof of at least three Covid vaccinations</h3>

You can do this via the paper card you carry in your wallet or by showing us your digital “NHS Covid Pass”.
To get the NHS Covid Pass you’ll need to register on the NHS App and download it to your phone ahead of time. To register, the process takes around 5-10 mins but it can take up to 24 hours for the NHS to process so please do this ahead of time. You can then save the pass into your digital wallet for easy access.

* International attendees should provide an equivalent certification from their country.
* If you have medical reasons why you have not been vaccinated please let the volunteers know. We understand there will need to be exemptions for some cases.


<h3> We ask you to take a lateral flow test prior to attending the event </h3>

While we are not requiring proof of negative lateral flow at the event we kindly ask that you take a test before attending the 
event both days for everyone's safety. 

Lateral flow tests can be ordered online from most pharmacies. 


<h3> Ask you to choose a wrist band.</h3>

The wrist band will indicate if you are socially distancing or not.

<b> Red band: </b>Please keep your distance.
<br>
<b> Green band: </b> I'm not socially distancing.

We thank you in advance for being respectful about peoples choices around their social distancing requirements.

<h2>Throughout the conference</h2>
It is not a socially distanced conference so there is no requirement for you to keep your distance from your friends, but please be respectful of others who may want to keep their distance.
<br><br>
Face mask wearing will be optional, depending on your comfort levels. We <b>strongly</b> encourage mask wearing during the event.

We will provide hand sanitiser around the venue for use throughout the day


<h2>Thank you for your patience</h2>
These additional checks will mean it takes a little longer to check you in than we would usually like, but hope you understand we are taking these precautions so that everyone feels safe and relaxed and can enjoy the event.

<h2>Changes</h2>
We may need to amend these policies due to local or national guidance or legislation. We will be in touch prior to the event
to confirm the COVID requirements.
