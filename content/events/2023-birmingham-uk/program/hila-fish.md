Terraform is a GREAT tool, but like a lot of other things in life, it has its pitfalls and bad practices.
Since you are working with Terraform, you probably went through its documentation, which can tell you what resources can be used - BUT do you always have a clear path towards using these resources? How should you structure your Terraform code in general?

And what about scaling? How do you make the most of Terraform when scaling your infrastructure as your organization grows?

In this talk, I’ll cover useful best practices, pitfalls to avoid and major obstacles to anticipate so that you can scale across many teams, avoid refactoring, and get a flying start now -- AND optimize for the future.

You’ll also gain a go-to approach and a paved way for working with Terraform, whether it’s an existing codebase or a new functionality altogether, and also hopefully make you think about the big picture and utilize Terraform in a broader context rather than just an “infrastructure as code" tool.
