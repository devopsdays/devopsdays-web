Docs-as-code is a method of writing documentation in which the documentation is treated like source code and follows a similar workflow. In this talk, Joanna will explore in more detail why the docs-as-code approach is important to both content creators and developers, what's the difference between a normal review cycle and a docs-as-code one, and how exactly such approach benefits the development cycle.
