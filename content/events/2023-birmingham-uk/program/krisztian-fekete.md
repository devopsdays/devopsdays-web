 eBPF is hard. There are more and more docs and blogs, but the learning curve seems to be really steep. Where could you possibly start to play around with this new technology?
			In this talk, I will briefly introduce the (e)BPF landscape, then show you one of the easiest way to get started with eBPF. We will explore existing tools, and see what it takes to drop them into a Kubernetes cluster, and learn how can you expose their output as Prometheus metrics with only a few keystrokes.
