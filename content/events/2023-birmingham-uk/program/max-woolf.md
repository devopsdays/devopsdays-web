Being told that something you worked hard on isn't perfect is uncomfortable. Telling others something that they worked hard on isn't perfect is even harder. Code review is a critical part of being a software engineer and doing it well can be a huge factor when looking to progress your career to a senior level and beyond. In this 30 minute talk, I'll give a history of how I learned to be a code reviewer, how *you* can be a better reviewer and, most importantly, how not to want to cry and throw in the towel when someone tells you your code isn't perfect. **We are not our code**, and the quicker we become comfortable with it, the quicker we can reach code review nirvana.
