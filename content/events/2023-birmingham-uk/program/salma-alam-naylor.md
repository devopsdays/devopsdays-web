As a front end developer you're juggling countless skills. Responsive design, building for accessibility, browser support, page performance — it's a lot. And if you want to go Full Stack™️, it can be a challenge to find the time and brain space to learn how to scale and secure a back end on top of building the app itself. So how can you unlock your full stack potential without the pain? You fake it, don't make it! (The back end, that is.) In this talk, you'll learn how serverless and edge runtimes are empowering front end developers to be more productive than ever, and how we as front end devs, can leverage this modern tooling to do things we only ever dreamed of.
