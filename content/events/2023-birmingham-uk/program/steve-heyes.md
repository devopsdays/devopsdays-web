There are a lot of books and talk about being a good leader, and yet a good leader seems to be rare to find. In this talk Steve will be looking at the myths surrounding leadership and how you don't need to be in the C-Suite or a manager to be one. He'll then get into what a leader actually is and how to grow at being one.
