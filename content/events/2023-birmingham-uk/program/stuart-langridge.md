About privacy, and how people are scared and uneasy about what's being done with their data. And how we need to stop building new technology and start working out how to explain to everyone that it is possible to build a world where you don't have to feel exploited and frightened and you still have all the same internet superpowers that you have today. We'll help developers understand how to build web apps that preserve privacy without giving up their technology, help managers to learn how to help users feel in control while still meeting their business goals, and help founders understand that privacy is an advantage that their rivals won't, or can't, compete with. Stuart Langridge, the author of http://web.dev's Learn Privacy course and contributor to Smashing Magazine's Ethics and Privacy, shows how for users, developers, managers, and founders, privacy could be the next big thing
