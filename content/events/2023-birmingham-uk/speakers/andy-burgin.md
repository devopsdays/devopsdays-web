Andy is Principal Platform Engineer at Flutter UK and Ireland. He considers himself a Kubernetes and DevRel fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn't. He is a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London and has been running the DevOps meetup in Leeds for 8 years hosting over 40 events. He's attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his own words is 'an all-round DevOps nuisance'
