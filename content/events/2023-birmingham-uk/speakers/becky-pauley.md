 Working as a primary school teacher, I started learning Python in my spare time- and got hooked on the feeling of solving problems. A few years ago I finally made the leap from teaching into tech! Since then, I"ve worked in Platform and Cloud Engineering roles- most recently at Jetstack with a focus on Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies. As well as all things infrastructure, Iâ€™m passionate about ways of working, learning and culture.
