Dwayne McDaniel has been working as a Developer Relations professional since 2015 and has been involved in the wider tech community since 2005.  He loves sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm about Git, Open Source tools, and tech in general and he has done so at over a hundred events all over the world.  He has been fortunate enough to speak at institutions like MIT, Stanford, and far-off places like Paris and Iceland.  You can see some of his past talks on Drupal.tv and WordPress.tv.

Dwayne currently lives in Chicago, right beside Lake Michigan. Outside of tech you might find him leading an event after-party to a Karaoke spot or quietly knitting a new hat.
