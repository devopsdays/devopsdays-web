I am a CS Freshman at The University of Toronto. I love researching and working with Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision (with papers in ICLR, Nature, and ACM SIGGRAPH among others, and have served as a PC/ reviewer for NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ICML, TPAMI, and more). Coming from a software and robotics background, I contribute extensively to/ maintain popular open-source projects like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, PapersWithCode, freeCodeCamp among others. I also love building open-source projects (usually related to Kubernetes and Machine Learning), some of which have been pretty popular and could be found on my GitHub. Seeing my work at a rather young age, I was invited to speak at 2 TEDx and 1 TED-Ed event. Furthermore, I have also represented my country in international olympiads.
