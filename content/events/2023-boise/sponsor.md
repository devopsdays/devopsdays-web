devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on [sponsorships](https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2023/boise/2023-boise-devopsdays-prospectus.pdf).

We do not sell product presentations or distribute attendee contact lists.

Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.

Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

If you are interested in sponsoring, please check out our [Sponsorship Prospectus](https://assets.devopsdays.org/events/2023/boise/2023-boise-devopsdays-prospectus.pdf) or <a href="mailto:boise-sponsors@devopsdays.org?subject=Interested%20in%20Sponsoring%20DevOpsDays%20Boise%202023">send us an email</a>.
