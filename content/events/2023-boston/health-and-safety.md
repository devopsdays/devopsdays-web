In order to ensure the health and safety of all our attendees, staff, speakers, sponsors, and venue partners, DevOpsDays Boston has instituted the following COVID-19 policy for our 2023 event:

We are requiring vaccination for in-person attendance. All in-person participants (including sponsors, speakers, staff, and attendees) must have completed a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two weeks prior to this event, by October 2nd, 2023. We will require proof of vaccination – acceptable proof must show that you have received at least two doses of a two-dose vaccine, or at least one dose of a one-dose vaccine, at least fourteen days ago, and bear the same name as on your valid state, federal, or passport ID. A negative COVID test will not be accepted as a substitute for proof of vaccination.

We welcome travelers from outside of the US, but do not necessarily have expertise in validating non-CDC-issued vaccine cards. Please reach out to us at [boston@devopsdays.org](mailto:boston@devopsdays.org) ahead of the conference, so that we can ensure that we’re prepared to validate your vaccine card.

Masks will be provided for individuals who prefer to wear them inside the venue, but are not required this year.

If you are feeling sick on either day of the event, we strongly encourage you to stay home and not try to attend.

If you cannot comply with these requirements, we ask that you request a ticket refund by October 2nd, 2023 if applicable.
