Building a software system that has complex integration points with other teams, or just trying to avoid miscommunications with your boss and coworkers, especially while working remotely... in a pandemic... or all of the above: that's tough.

This talk covers a set of data-driven best practices: "Metrics as a Shared Language" that were built for these types of situations.

Using real world successes and (hilariously cringe-worthy) failures as examples, this talk reviews these principles and how to implement them (and avoid common anti-patterns).

This will cover how to set up system metrics in a way that they can be best leveraged as a communication tool for a variety of different internal audiences/stakeholders. Then, how to use these to automate some of the most common cross-team communication breakdowns inherent in complex systems engineering, as well as inherent in remote workplace interactions. All examples use open source software.
