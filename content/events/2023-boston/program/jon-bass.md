Let’s reconsider the role that human decision making should have in least privilege implementations. It seems that automation will mitigate risk by reducing human error, but simply replacing humans with robots has lots of unintended consequences. Unchecked automation leads to brittle systems and new bottlenecks.

You’ll leave this talk with ideas on how to build safe least privilege systems for humans that are supported by machines, rather than replaced by them.
