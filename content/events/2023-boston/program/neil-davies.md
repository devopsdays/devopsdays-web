We have operational metrics everywhere. These are often siloed with the system providing the service and/or donâ€™t keep enough history to identify longer-term trends. In order to help answer more strategic questions, we want to combine this data behind a single pane of glass and look for trends and insights to help understand pain points, areas requiring optimization, and business risk.

This talk covers both how OM1 built a pipeline (as-code) with open-source tooling that pulls data from commonly used devops platforms including monitoring data, security insights, CI/CD data, test and quality data, cost and usage data, incident response data and issue tracking data and the interesting key insights we found on the way.
