## <a name="hotels">Hotels:
The Transit Drive-in is located in a rural community a few miles North and East of Buffalo. There is minimal travel pressure across the region during early October, so blocks of rooms at a specific hotel have not been prepared in advance. For locations near the venue, we would suggest:

### Hampton Inn Lockport - Buffalo
6082 S Transit Rd
Lockport, NY 14094

### Holiday Inn Express
6900 S Transit Rd
Lockport, NY 14094

---

A more central location, about mid-way between the venue and downtown Buffalo, can be found in the Town of Amherst near the University at Buffaloâ€™s North Campus. For this area we would suggest:

### DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Buffalo - Amherst
10 Flint Rd
Amherst, NY 14226

### Buffalo Marriott Niagara
1340 Millersport Hwy
Amherst, NY 14221   -->
