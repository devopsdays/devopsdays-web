## <a name="seneca-one"></a>Seneca One Tower:

The event space at Seneca One proved to be an excellent choice for our event in 2022. The space has a focus around tech and innovation and also highlights some of the exciting investment and development happenings across the Buffalo region. We believe this option feels closer to the action and helps showcase the regionâ€™s rebirth.

Built between 1969 and 1974, Seneca One tower in downtown Buffalo is one of the most iconic buildings in the city skyline. Formerly known as the Marine Midland Center, and later One HSBC Center, Seneca One is the tallest building in Buffalo at 40-floors and 529 Feet in height offering uninterrupted 360-degree skyline views of downtown Buffalo. Recently redeveloped by Douglas Development as a multi-use property that includes dining, professional, and residential spaces, Seneca One has become a destination for entrepreneurs, innovation, and technology in the heart of downtown Buffalo. Seneca One is conveniently located in proximity to a large selection of dining options, recreational activities offered by the Buffalo waterfront, lodging, sporting venues, and purveyors of libation.

The auditorium at Seneca One can support up to 250 individuals and is wheelchair accessible (including restrooms, gallery spaces, and dining). Service animals are welcome in the facility and live captioning will be available during the conference presentations.
