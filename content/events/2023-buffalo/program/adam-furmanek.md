We don’t need to run the query to see how it’s going to perform. We can ask the database to tell us exactly what it’s going to do. We can capture these details with OpenTelemetry and combine them with signals from our HTTP layer, ORM library, and database driver. Finally, we can analyze these with machine learning algorithms, to automatically troubleshoot issues, identify improvements, and submit corrections.

In this talk we are going to see how to use OpenTelemtry with modern databases to reason about the performance and correctness of our applications. We are going to use expert knowledge supported by AI to fix problems automatically. All of that for free with modern tooling.
