Title = "How a Unicorn Migrated From an In-House Solution to Helm"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["mey-beisaron"]
+++

Creating your first Helm Chart is one thing, but migrating 400+ services - all relying on an existing solution - is a whole different story.
This is the point where "Helm 101" tutorials become irrelevant.

In this talk we will go through our unique Helm charts architecture, integrating Helm with existing systems and, finally, deployment to production.

By the end of this talk you will learn practical techniques to leverage Helm while taking into consideration existing systems and boosting dev velocity in the process.
