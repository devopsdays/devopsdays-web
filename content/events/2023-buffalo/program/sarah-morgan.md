What do you do with all of the data coming out of your systems? Are you spending time diagnosing issues in your distributed systems without a good understanding of how your microservices are built? As system complexity increases, the ability to understand the sum of the outputs becomes more and more difficult and the volume of data about your services becomes overwhelming. Luckily, having an observability mindset when instrumenting your outputs and leveraging the right tool for your team can help you cut through the noise and identify key offenders in your system and resolve them quickly and efficiently.

In this talk, we will discuss the differences between traditional performance monitoring and observability and how to understand how they can independently and together ensure the health of your team and keep your end users (and your developers!) happy and focused on the right things.
