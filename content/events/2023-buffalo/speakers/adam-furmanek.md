##### DevRel at Metis
I am Adam Furmanek, and I am a professional software engineer with over a decade of experience. In my career, I worked with all layers of software engineering and multiple types of applications, including logistics, e-commerce, machine learning, data analysis, and database management. I am always interested in digging deeper, exploring machine code, and going through implementation details to better understand the internals of the technologies I use every day. That's why I like debugging, decompiling and disassembling the code to understand memory models, concurrency problems and other details hidden deeply inside.
