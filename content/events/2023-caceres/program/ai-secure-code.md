<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is already acting as a copilot in our daily lives, acting as a digital assistant or providing personalized experiences. Despite progress in many other areas, AI has historically stopped short of improving software development practices. Enter GitHub Copilot: the software industry's first artificial intelligence solution that distills the collective knowledge of the world's developers into an editor extension that suggests code in real time. ChatGPT then took the world by storm with its conversational capabilities and public reactions have been quite telling.

This makes the process of building great software easier and faster, but what about more secure? In this session, we'll demonstrate how GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can help developers write more secure code through real-world use cases. The audience will come away with tips and best practices from the lessons we learned from experimenting with the tools.</p>
