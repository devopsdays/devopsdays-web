<p>In the software development process, the database introduces some challenges when we want to articulate with the application development. When all database changes can be described with scripts, version control can be applied unlocking continuous integration and continuous delivery capabilities.

In this session I will explore the database challenges of each stage of the deployment pipeline, how to use automation to make de deployment pipeline repeatable, reliable and fast, reducing the fear around database changes, and identify the different configurations of the deployment pipeline while articulating database and applications.</p>
