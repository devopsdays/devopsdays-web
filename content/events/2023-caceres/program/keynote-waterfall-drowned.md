<p>Once upon a time, there was a company that embraced Agilism and DevOps to the bone. But then one day, anti-patterns started popping up like mushrooms. Suddenly, there was a 2-year long waterfall process going on, delivery was stopped and a once flourishing company was one step closer to bankruptcy.

How could this happen? Wasnâ€™t waterfall a thing of the past? How is this all related to Queer Theories and toxic masculinity patterns?

Using this story as a study case, we will review why the DevOps culture not only grants better delivery, but also happier teams, better grounds for diversity, and less anxious alpha males.</p>
