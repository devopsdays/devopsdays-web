<p>In this talk, we will apply the Lean principles to reduce the 8 types of Lean waste in a CI-CD to make it more efficient and effective. We will walk through the example of an ideal Lean CI-CD pipeline to deploy a workload to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Previous experience with CI-CD, Kubernetes and Helm is welcome but not required.</p>
