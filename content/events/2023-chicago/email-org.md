# Global Organizer Summit and DevOpsDays Chicago 2023 are finally here!

The conference starts with the Global Organizer Summit on Tuesday, August 8th and continues with DevOpsDays Chicago itself Wednesday, August 9th, and continues Thursday, August 10th. *Please note that your tickets might refer to the event dates as August 9-10, but remember that the Organizer Summit is on August 8!* Registration, breakfast, and sponsor tables will be open daily at 8AM. The organizers are excited to welcome you! Here are a few details you’ll want to review before the event.

## Code of Conduct

Respect and empathy are core DevOps values. Make sure to read [our code of conduct](https://www.devopsdays.org/chicago/conduct/)! We will enforce it. Any attendee who violates the code of conduct may be asked to leave without a refund, at the discretion of the organizers (who can be identified by red conference shirts).

Additionally we are using [CallOfConduct](https://www.callofconduct.com/) to help facilitate code of conduct reporting this year. You will be getting an automated email from CallOfConduct about one week prior to the event. Any code of conduct violations you experience or witness should be reported through this site so the organizers can respond. 

## Health and Safety

Our [Health and Safety policy](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/covid-19-policy) requires all participants to show proof of vaccination or provide a negative COVID test. If you cannot comply with these requirements, you may participate virtually by watching our livestream and interacting online.

It is highly recommended that you confirm the availability of your Covid 19 vaccination record before you leave home, as many countries and locations  have shut down their vaccination proof apps.

Please reach out to us at chicago@devopsdays.org if you have questions on vaccination proof methods; generally speaking if you have a card/document certifies that you have been vaccinated you should be fine.  In the worst case scenario, we will be providing tests on-site as an alternative.

## Location

DevOpsDays Global Organizer Summit and DevOpsDays Chicago 2023 are being held at Convene in the Willis (Sears) Tower at 233 S. Wacker Drive.

## Organizer Summit Schedule

Check out the [full program](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-organizer-summit/program) for the Organizer Summit day! We have talks in the morning and then Open Spaces in the afternoon.

## DevOpsDays Chicago Schedule

We have an amazing program planned for the conference. Please take a look at the [speaker](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/speakers/) lineup and the full [program](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/program/)!

Consider what topics you’d like to propose for [Open Space self-organizing discussions](https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/) in the afternoons; many people find that to be their most valuable time at DevOpsDays.

This year, we will also offer workshops in the afternoon of each day.

All the talks will be simultaneously transcribed to accommodate those with hearing issues (or who just like to turn the subtitles on during movies). Attendees can also follow the transcription on their own devices (phone, tablet, laptop). The link for the transcription stream will also be available on [the program page](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2023-chicago/program/).

## Social Media

The conference Twitter hashtag will be #devopsdays. Please tweet, blog, and otherwise share what you learn with everyone who isn’t able to attend but could benefit from your experience!

## Food & Drink

Breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and non-stop coffee and other cold beverage options will be served on-site at the conference. We can accommodate most dietary restrictions you listed in your registration. If you have questions about food options, ask an organizer or volunteer for information.

We also have assembled a [Guide to Chicago](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-organizer-summit/guide-to-chicago/) for out of town friends, so check that out as well!

As you’re searching for dinner and late-night options, Yelp is a great source in downtown Chicago. Calling ahead or using OpenTable is a good idea as wait times at popular places can exceed an hour.

## Directions from the airports

From the O’Hare airport, it’s about a 50-minute CTA Blue line train ride toward downtown Chicago to the Clark/Lake station, where you should transfer to the Orange or Pink line and get off at Quincy. From the Midway airport, it is about a 30-minute CTA Orange line ride toward downtown Chicago to the Quincy station.

## Transit directions within the city

The conference location is quite accessible via CTA trains. The nearest stop is the Quincy stop for the Brown, Purple, Orange, and Pink lines. For Blue, Green, or Red lines, transfer at either Jackson or State/Lake stops to one of the above lines. See the [CTA website](https://transitchicago.com) for train routes and schedules!
