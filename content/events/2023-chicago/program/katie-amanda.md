Technology drives value and innovation in every organization. At Google Cloud, we have learned a lot about what it takes to build and scale high-performing technology teams. Our own lived experience combined with a multi-year research program led by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team can be used to help you and your team transform into a high-performing technology team.

This talk will dive into some of the findings of the 2022 DORA research program.

We will couple these findings with stories from the field about how teams are putting these ideas into practice. There will be success stories and cautionary tales: let's all learn from one another.

Spoiler alert! The best teams focus on getting better at getting better. You can do this, too!
