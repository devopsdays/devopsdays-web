One little PowerShell script:  it's just another day in DevOps.

But it could be superpowers for your Helpdesk.

Maybe your company -- government -- nonprofit -- will never employ enough programmers to develop the kinds of pipelines, libraries, code review processes, and other signs of DevOps maturity that will put your team in textbooks.

Yet each little automation can be game-changing to your organization's information technology service management ("ITSM") maturity.

I'll show you my script that combines 5 folders into a ZIP file -- and saved my colleagues days of work.

What "one little automation" can you help write?
