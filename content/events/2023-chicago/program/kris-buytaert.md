15 years of #devops<br>
But what has really changed ...<br>
Are we finally doing CI/CD now ?<br>
That's  Continuous Isolation and Continuous Disintegration right ?<br>
Do we really benefit from Infrastructure as Code ?<br>
Or was shoving everything in a container the right solution ?<br>
Did we fix anything ?<br>
Or did we make it worse ?<br>
Or did we fix it for some ?<br>
And make it worse for others.<br>
But one thing is for sure ... Platform Engineering wil solve it ..<br>
Again ..
