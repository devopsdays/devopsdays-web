I am 11 years old, but my dad has been talking about DevOps my entire life. I will be talking about what I think DevOps is about from having to listen to him talk about it all the time. I mean *all the time*. 

After you watch this talk you will know how DevOps works and maybe think more like a kid than you do today.
