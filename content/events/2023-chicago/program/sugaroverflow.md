Technical debt is a common challenge in tech, but it can quickly become overwhelming without the right tools and culture. In this talk, I will share my experience maintaining an open-source repository and the valuable lessons I learned along the way.

I'll never forget my first open-source repository maintenance project - it promised to be the resume-booster of a lifetime, but instead led to a showdown with structural resourcing issues and an epic battle against burnout. Attendees will experience the journey of facing insurmountable tech debt, pushing for resources, struggling with burnout, and the quest of learning your own worth.
