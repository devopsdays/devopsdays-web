In 2023, the demand for secure software development skills is at an all-time high. As DevOps professionals, we need to focus on secure CI/CD pipelines, helping developers secure code, and securing supply chains.

During this workshop we'll discuss best practices to lock down CI pipelines and how to find vulnerabilities in our dependencies. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities have remained the same for a long time, indicating that there's still a lot of work to be done. This workshop is designed to take you through the entire SDLC with a critical eye on security.
