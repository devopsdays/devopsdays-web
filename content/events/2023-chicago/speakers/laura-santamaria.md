As a Lead Developer Advocate at Dell Technologies, Laura Santamaria loves to learn and explain how things work to bridge the gaps in engineering disciplines. She is the curator for [A Minute on the Mic](https://aminuteonthemic.com), a cohost for [The Hallway Track](https://thehallwaytrack.fireside.fm/) podcast, and the ex-host of [Quick Bites of Cloud Engineering](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyy8Vx2ZoWlohOiedbaQqT5xYRkcDsm10) on YouTube. As a community member, she co-hosts Austin DevOps and Cloud Austin, taught Python for Women Who Code Austin for many years, organizes DevOpsDays Austin, is a member of the PyTexas Foundation, and has been a returning program committee member for Open Source Summit's Cloud Open track. Outside of tech, Laura runs, plays with her dogs, throws discs, and watches clouds - the real kind.
