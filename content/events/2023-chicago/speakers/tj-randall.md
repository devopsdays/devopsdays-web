T.j. spent seventeen years in enterprise healthcare & insurance before making the leap to startups.  He combines hands-on development and automation experience with a passion for studying the intersections of business and technology.    That's a fancy way of saying that T.j. focuses on everyone in the delivery pipeline... not just the code.

T.j. is passionate about CI / CD / DevOps, and loved his time at XebiaLabs, helping customers transform to modern delivery practices. He is now the CXO for Instruqt, where he can combine his love of education by focusing on Developer education and Developer Experience.
