## <a name='ThursdayAfternoonRaffle'></a>Thursday Afternoon Raffle

At 1:30 pm on Thursday we have time allotted for you to give away any raffle/prizes on stage in front of everyone! Please be lined up on the side of the stage starting at 1:20pm. To move things along please follow these guidelines:

* You should already have the names of your winner(s) selected before coming on stage. If the person must be present to win, please have a few alternate names to go through if they aren’t here!
* After announcing your winner(s), proceed to the other end of the stage where you can have a photo taken with your winner(s) alongside the DevOpsDays Yak mascot!

## <a name='EveningEvents'></a>Evening Events

There is no official conference evening event; however, if you are planning to host a party or happy hour, etc after either day of the conference, please let us know the details! We will include this information in communications to attendees. Please send the details to chicago-sponsors@devopsdays.org

## <a name='OtherFAQs'></a>Other FAQs

**How many people will be attending the conference?**

We are expecting 550-600 people at the conference.

**What are the demographics of the attendees?**

DevOpsDays conferences typically attract software, operations, infosec, QA, and build engineers, as well as architects and technology managers. From voluntary attendee data, 22% had VP or Director-level titles, 17% had senior level titles, and over 85% had technical roles.

These folks are attending to learn and to share learnings about the DevOps movement. They most appreciate sponsors who engage with them with that in mind.

**Will sponsors get an email list of attendees? Do we get a dedicated email blast?**

No, we will not be sending out a formalized list.

Platinum and Gold sponsors will have their logos in all conference emails to participants. We cannot send out emails on behalf of sponsors and will not share contact information or lists of attendee names.

**When can we pick our booth spot?**

Booths are assigned accordingly to sponsor level, then prioritized by when payment was received. We try not to place competitors next to each other and try to accommodate any requests.

**What is the booth set up? Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?**

Booths are long tables ( 72" x 30") with a black tablecloth and power strip and 2 chairs. We recommend bringing/shipping: signage, handouts, pop-up banners, giveaways, etc. Banners must fit behind your booth.

![](/events/2023-chicago/booth.png)<br>
*A Gold sponsor table from 2019*

**How many scanners (and which type) do we get?**

This is not your typical conference. The booth is a place to interact with people during breaks.

Sponsors​ ​benefit​​ ​most​ ​when​ ​they actively​ ​participate​.

You are responsible for collecting any information in person. Raffles with a business card draw work well. Just let us know and we will give time on Day 2 to announce raffle winners between talks and lunch. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference, attend talks, and actively participate in open space sessions with the other attendees.

**What is the 20% off code for additional sponsorship tickets?**

[SPONSOR-2023-H5P2](https://chicago-tickets.devopsdays.org/2023/redeem?voucher=SPONSOR-2023-H5P2) (click to register directly)

**Who should staff the booth? What are expo hours?**

If your goal is recruiting, consider sending engineering managers. If you are a vendor, send your sales engineers as well as your technical product marketing, and even some engineers. DevOpsDays are about quality, not quantity - it's about active participation!

**Can we do a giveaway on stage?**

Yes. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g. business cards, entry slips, etc.) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use. After the ignites on the second day, we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.

**Can I sponsor a talk?**

Absolutely not. Devopsdays does not sell conference speaking slots; sponsors' employees are welcome to submit talk proposals.

**Can I get a discount for sponsoring multiple DevOpsDays?**

All DevOpsDays events are independently organized, so no multi-city sponsorships are available.

**Who organizes DevOpsDays Chicago?**

Your [DevOpsDays Chicago organizers](https://devopsdays.org/chicago/contact) are Chicago-based technology folks who volunteer their time for this event.

All money collected from sponsors goes towards the conference and its related expenses. We are not a non-profit, so sponsorships are not tax deductible. Contact us at chicago-sponsors@devopsdays.org  to get our W9.

For any other questions, email all of us at <chicago@devopsdays.org>
