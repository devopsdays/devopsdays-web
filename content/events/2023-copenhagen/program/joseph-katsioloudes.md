Artificial intelligence is already acting as a copilot in our daily lives, by helping as a digital assistant or by providing personalized experiences. Despite progress in other areas, historically AI has stopped short of improving software development. For the first time in the history of software, GitHub Copilot distills the collective knowledge of the world’s developers into an editor extension that suggests code in real time. This makes the process of building great software easier and faster… but what about more secure? In this session, we’ll show how we can help developers to write more secure code by using GitHub CoPilot. We will demo real-world use cases and will provide tips from our lessons learned when experimenting with the tool.
