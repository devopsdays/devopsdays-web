As a developer in a digital product team, it is important to have access to the right resources at the right time to be successful.

In The LEGO Group we are bridging this gap by providing a developer platform that binds engineers, resources and information together in an eco-system. We call this Baseplate. In this presentation, we will show you how we have managed to scale and democratise our platform by making it easy for other teams to contribute to its foundation.

By the end of this talk, you'll have a clear understanding of how Baseplate is making a difference for our developers and how its extensibility can unlock new possibilities for your company.
