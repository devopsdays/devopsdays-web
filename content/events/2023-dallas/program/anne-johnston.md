##### TALK ABSTRACT

Capital One has been on the public cloud journey since 2015 and has transformed from a consumer product organization into a leading FinTech. The early days of Capital One’s migration to AWS were about being in the cloud and has since transitioned into thriving in the cloud. To thrive, we’ve implemented well managed principles with FinOps at the center of each decision. In this session, we’ll discuss our journey to create a FinOps organization, what we’ve learned from managing cloud infrastructure at scale, how to measure success and the keys to a thriving FinOps team.
