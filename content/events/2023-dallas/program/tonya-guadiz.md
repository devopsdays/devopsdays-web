##### TALK ABSTRACT

In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing workplace, becoming a Most Valuable Player (MVP) on your team requires more than just technical expertise. The ability to build trust and credibility is essential to becoming a valuable member of any team. As a result, it is critical to identify and cultivate the key skills and qualities necessary to become an MVP on your team.

Over the last 15 years, we’ve guided teams both within our company and at our clients to achieve and grow beyond where they thought they could. Our consulting firm has grown from a small startup to 1,800+ person organization across three countries. Our clients experience our teams as this sort of MVP, and that comes from a system of knowing how to teach these skills across an organization.

This presentation will explore the critical components of building trust and credibility, including effective communication, building relationships, and demonstrating a strong work ethic. Participants will learn how to develop and maintain trust with their colleagues, build their credibility through their actions and words, and leverage their strengths to contribute meaningfully to their team’s success.

Additionally, we will provide practical tips and strategies that participants can immediately implement to build their reputation as a trusted and respected member of their team. Whether you are a new employee or a seasoned professional, this presentation will help you identify the skills and qualities necessary to succeed in the ever-changing workplace.
