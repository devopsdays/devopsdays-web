I am a passionate technologist who loves to make life easier for developers and tech enthusiasts. When DevOps was first getting started I jumped in with both feet joining the community in 2015 and bringing those learnings back to American Airlines. In 2017 I stood up the Dojo coaching practices at American Airlines where we worked with teams to improve their overall development skills, tech stack and their ability to deliver value sooner while meeting the necessary security controls. Today I lead the DX platform teams who complement the Dojo in ensuring developer experience is a delight and promotes technical excellence.
