Don Bauer started his career in 2007 as a metrics analyst and systems engineer with Charter Communications. Since then, he has held roles in development, infrastructure, architecture, and operations for both enterprise corporations and startups. He immediately recognized a common thread in each role that allowed him to focus on enabling teams and companies to succeed through standardization, simplification, automation, and experimentation. Don believes that both companies and teams succeed through transparency and experimentation without the fear of failure. Don operates with a simple principle: to automate himself out of a job. He primarily focuses on automating the integration and delivery of software and services, and he supports innovation using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. In addition to his professional passions, Don is also a husband and a father of two children.
