I have a team-first mentality, and my passions are in technology & with connecting with and to people. My superpower is being vulnerable, and in that Iâ€™m able to personify the openness and welcoming attitude for the community, as a member of the community, and as a leader of the community. Championing others and working with diverse teams is also critical for success in an organization & with teams I work with cross-organizationally. I try to be very thoughtful about how I impact the big picture and how the interconnected parts of the organization work together to make everyone better.
