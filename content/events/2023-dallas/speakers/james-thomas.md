James has been a lifelong enthusiast of technology, and has been lucky enough to be paid to tinker with it about the past 20 years. He in particular has a fondness for infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, which when given the proper care are oftentimes the unsung hero of any successful delivery team. James has been a consultant for over half his career, and finds it to be the perfect means of combining his desire to help people with his love of technology.

In his spare time you can find James taking his young daughters to the park, playing board games with friends and family, or working on the seemingly endless home improvement projects he finds himself doing.
