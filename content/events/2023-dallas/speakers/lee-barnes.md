I have over 25 years of experience in the Software Quality Assurance and Testing field. I have been involved in the implementation of test automation and performance testing solutions in hundreds of environments across a wide array of industries. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been involved with bringing quality practices (with a focus on automation and performance) to agile and DevOps teams.

I regularly speak at industry conferences including StarEAST/WEST, DevOpsDays, Agile+DevOps East/West, STPCon, EuroStar, and TestCon Europe.
