Say goodbye to hiding your accomplishments! Learn how to confidently shine in tech & overcome Tall Poppy Syndrome, and help others do the same. A must-attend practical session for all levels that will change the way you look at developer culture.

The term ‘Tall Poppy Syndrome’ was popularized in Australia, and as an Australian, I will be sharing my personal experiences and insights on navigating the tricky topic of Tall Poppy Syndrome in the tech industry.

Many people may be familiar with the concept of imposter syndrome, but tall poppy syndrome is different. This talk will explore the difference between the two and how tall poppy syndrome can manifest in the workplace. Brooke will also touch on how it differs from arrogance, and how to avoid being perceived as arrogant while still being confident in your abilities.

If you don’t know how to share your accomplishments at work, or you feel like you can’t confidently showcase your contributions without seeming arrogant, this session is for you. Whether you’re just starting out in your tech career or you’re an experienced leader, you’ll take away valuable strategies and fresh perspectives to help you succeed in tech without being “cut down.”

By the end of the session, you will have a better understanding of Tall Poppy Syndrome, and how to handle it, you’ll be able to confidently showcase your achievements and contributions and be able to help others do the same.
