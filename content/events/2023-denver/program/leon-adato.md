Working in tech is a never-ending stream of choices: from the language, platform, and framework we use to the vendors we put our trust (and money) in. Many of us live in fear that our next choice will turn sour, and will end up being a resume-generating event for us.

In reality, there is often a lot more good than you’d expect from those seemingly bad tech choices. In this session, I’ll look back on several failed implementations, poor calls, and wasted weekends to see, with the benefit of hindsight, how they turned out to be decent decisions after all.
