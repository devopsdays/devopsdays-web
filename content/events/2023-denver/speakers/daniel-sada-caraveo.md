I like to sleep at night knowing my services are OK, I’ve written blog posts about software that saves me more than 100 hours of time and I used to be a OneNote Services developer. I’ve tried every coffee shop in a 25 mile radius around my house. I write in English and Spanish. I work at Snowflake improving Developer Productivity.
