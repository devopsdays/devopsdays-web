Dedicated and driven technology leader and software engineer with a passion for people and reliable software, as well as the intersection between those two worlds.

I truly believe that safety is pivotal with software development nowadays. If we donâ€™t think about the safety and reliability of the product we are building for the humans that use it everyday (from the inception of our idea), then we are presenting a giant problem for humanity. From this passion, I decided to pursue a part-time, advanced degree in Human Factors and Systems Safety; which provides a unique complement to my understanding of how complex software systems fail.
