### Elevator Pitch

How might we unite the discovery and development world so we are working on the right thing, at the right pace, leveraging our shared expertise? Using Dual-Track, we end the 'over-the-wall' handoff, build shared understanding, and have buy-in across the disciplines of product, design, and engineering. 

### Description

Edward Cupps will give an overview of Dual Track Development, first suggested by Desiree Sy and championed by Marty Cagan and Jeff Patton, dual track is an approach to building collaborative product teams that discovery early, ship quickly, and learn to iterate again. Colloquially called the "Mona Lisa Model" at a previous job of mine, dual track focuses on shipping-to-learn, iterating, and building toward the right product for your business and user needs. Edward will frame the process and recommend approaches and methods to help put it in action.
