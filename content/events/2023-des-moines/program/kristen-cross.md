### Elevator Pitch

According to the agile principles, "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams." But what does that actually mean? Even in small organizations, we're rarely able to hand-pick our teammates. And no matter who we're working with, we're often asked to work within a defined framework that allows for consistency between teams.
 
This session will start from the beginning to define what it means to be self-organizing. We'll discuss the benefits of a self-organizing team and discover how teams can take advantage of autonomy, even within the constraints of a larger organization.
 
Regardless of your role, you'll walk away with action items that will support you in participating, advocating, and driving the success of self-organizing teams in your specific context.

### Description

Intent: 
This 45 minute session will include short blocks of instruction followed by exercises aimed at encouraging attendees to fully grasp the benefits of self-organizing while understanding the constraints that might limit team autonomy in large organizations. Participants will EXAMINE what it means to be self-organizing, EVALUATE the benefits and constraints that self-organizing teams might face, and CREATE an action plan for enacting change in their own organization. 


Introduction (5 minutes):
- As participants are entering the room, they’ll have the opportunity to scan a QR code and participate in a WordCloud activity highlighting ""what do you think of when you hear the term ‘self-organizing’?""
- As a large group, highlight the most common (and most surprising) contributions
- Presenter introduction, credentials, and background
- Review agenda
 
Part 1 (10 mins) What is a Self-Organizing Team?: 
- Define “self-organizing” and compare with “self-managing” and “self-directing” 
- Explore two successful case studies that highlight the effectiveness of self-organizing teams
- Invite others in the room to share examples from their own experiences
 
Part 2 (15 mins) Balancing Team Autonomy and Organizational Alignment: 
- Activity (small group): Each group will be given a set of problems to solve as a small group. Each solution should be brought to the front of the room on a sticky note as quickly as possible. During the activity, teams will discover some unexpected management constraints and dependencies on the work of other teams. (groups of 3-5 will complete this activity to ensure the groups are small enough that each person can contribute)
- Reflection (think, pair, share): How might your team have worked differently if constraints were clearly defined at the beginning? What real-world situations might constrain self-organizing teams? (adapted from Frank Lyman’s think-pair-share educational strategy - attendees will begin by drafting thoughts individually. After a period of time, these thoughts will be shared with a partner or with the table. Use the table discussion to ask questions, offer suggestions, seek advice, refine and build on your personal reflections)


Part 3 (15 mins) Implementing Guardrails for Autonomous Teams: 
- Introduce the use of clear objectives as guardrails for teams
- Highlight the value of retrospectives, experimentation, and sharing learnings
- Review a check-list that can be used by teams to evaluate the constraints that might arise when making changes to process and flow 
- Reflection (think, pair, share): What actions can you take to advocate for, empower, and participate in self-organizing teams? (adapted from Frank Lyman’s think-pair-share educational strategy - attendees will begin by drafting thoughts individually. After a period of time, these thoughts will be shared with a partner or with the table. Use the table discussion to ask questions, offer suggestions, seek advice, refine and build on your personal reflections)
 
Closing (1 min):
- Potential next steps and contact information for those interested in learning more.
