### Elevator Pitch

If you’re tired of Kafka-esque transformation initiatives that seem to repeat like some kind of hellscape groundhogs day, then come on down for some insight into why most transformations fail and some possible ways it may be avoided.

### Description

"Organizational change always seems bigger, takes longer, and costs more than expected. And too often, the results do not fully deliver the desired outcomes…or worse.

But why is this so common?

Well, some of the most frequent reasons are:
- Only a small fraction of the entire org design is considered
- Leadership activities and behaviors don’t significantly shift
- The psychology of change is ignored or not incorporated
- The method for change follows known failure patterns

The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. Taking a systems-first, people-centered approach resolves all these problems! We will explore how to use the Key Forces of Change models to consider the entire org-design and its impact on change. Then, we will review aspects of change that put people at the forefront for consideration. Finally, we will wrap up with an evolutionary change model that addresses standard failure modes. You will leave with a broader, deeper toolbelt for achieving successful organizational change!
