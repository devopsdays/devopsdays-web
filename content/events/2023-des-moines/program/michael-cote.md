Now more than ever it's critical that you change how your work. Macroeconomic headwinds are creating an existential crisis for enterprises that must migrate from old ways of working to cloud native cultures. Software is eating the world.

You've certainly heard all of this for past ten years, probably at least once in the past ten minutes DevOps has always been about dramatic changes to improve IT. You don't only need to use a different set of tools, you need to change your entire IT culture!

It's all exhausting, really. Worse, this imperative to change never goes away. Will we ever actually be done and "be like Google"?

Instead of carrying the flag of "change or die," this talk proposes an alternate, more practical, sustainable, and comforting approach to improving: IncrativeOps.

("Incrative" is not a typo.)
