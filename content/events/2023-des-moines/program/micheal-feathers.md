### Elevator Pitch

There are advantages in treating development less like a steady-rate machine and more like an episodic activity done by teams making product decisions.

### Description

In many DevOps initiatives, the DORA metrics are treated as the gold standard. When teams have good scores on deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to recover, and change failure rate, we assume that we are on track, but this steady-state view doesn’t align with the fact that innovation and delivery are often episodic and have cadences that vary across the product life cycle. In this talk, we’ll look at the general issue of development and delivery cadence, and explore a model based on Kent Beck’s 3X which allows us to interpret and target DORA performance in terms of the natural cadences of product development.
