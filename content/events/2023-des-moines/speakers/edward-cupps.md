Edward Cupps will give an overview of Dual Track Development, first suggested by Desiree Sy and championed by Marty
Cagan and Jeff Patton, dual track is an approach to building collaborative product teams that discovery early, ship
quickly, and learn to iterate again. Colloquially called the "Mona Lisa Model" at a previous job of mine, dual track
focuses on shipping-to-learn, iterating, and building toward the right product for your business and user needs. Edward
will frame the process and recommend approaches and methods to help put it in action.
