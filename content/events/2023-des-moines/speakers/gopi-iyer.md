I have spent all of my career in the "software engineering"  - 20 plus years at major insurance and financial
organization managing and architecting all sorts of complex applications from security to modern day applications.

I got assigned to tremendous complex programs from Compliance Initiatives, Business System and Process Re-Engineering to
Cloud Migrations.

Currently, as an Engineering Manager I lead a team of 14+ software engineers.

At John Deere Financial, I am happily managing a team to execute another complex enterprise strategy to integrate and
share customer and accounts data within software applications.

To me, a thriving API strategy is one that fosters integrating data within systems in a way that is sustainable and
enriches the lives of engineers and I know I can't do it alone.
