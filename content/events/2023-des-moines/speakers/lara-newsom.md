Itâ€™s me! Lara Newsom! In addition to being an Angular GDE and giving conference talks online and around the globe, I am
also a co-host on the Angular Plus Show where we talk about all things Angular and Angular adjacent. During the day, I
am a Senior Software Engineering Technical Leader at Cisco working full time on a large enterprise Angular application
using NgRx state management and leveraging Nx Monorepos. I am always energized by sharing my knowledge and being part of
the software engineering community. I specialize in talking about cats and random facts but also love talking about
software.
