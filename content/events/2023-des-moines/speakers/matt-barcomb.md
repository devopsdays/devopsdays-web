Having served in roles from Principle Engineer to Product Executive, Matt has a 20+ year history of challenging mental
models and disrupting the status quo. He is an org-design leader and product strategist who takes an evidence-based,
outcomes-driven approach to evolve companies into systems-first, people-centered organizations. Matt takes satisfaction
from working with others to uncover the "why" behind the “what” while growing individuals' capabilities to meet future
needs.

He also enjoys homesteading, permaculture, hiking, and camping with his family of four in Concord Township, Ohio.
