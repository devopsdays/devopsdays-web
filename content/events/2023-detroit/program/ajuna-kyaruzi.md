You’ve saved the world (or at least your local dev environment) and are eating some celebratory shawarma. Now what? The post-incident world often looks different to the one before. What next?

We’ve heard of post-mortem documents and incident review meetings but are they successful? Did we figure out the root cause or just cure the effects? Have we made things more brittle in the process? Might we  have to repeat the steps in a month or three? 

This talk will go over some real life examples of incidents and their remediations to try to answer some of those questions, and also the hardest part: getting the ball rolling.
