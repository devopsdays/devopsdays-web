Title = "Finding Harmony in Distributed Systems: Choreography vs Orchestration in Software Development"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["rain-leander"]
+++

Why did the choreographer refuse to use orchestration in their distributed system? Because they wanted their components to dance to their own beat, without a central conductor! This talk explores the differences between choreography and orchestration in software development for distributed systems. Choreography involves the independent coordination of software components through message passing, while orchestration involves a central orchestrator managing the interactions between components. Through examples such as e-commerce and travel booking systems, the strengths and weaknesses of each approach are highlighted. By understanding the pros and cons of each approach, software developers can make informed decisions about which approach to use for their specific use case, ultimately finding harmony in their distributed systems.
