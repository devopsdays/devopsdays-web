As a DevOps Architect, I lead customers in designing and delivering solutions that adhere to industry standards and DevOps best practices. I focus on GitHub, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code automation, and CI/CD pipeline management.  While serving as a technical evangelist and thought leader, I also connect with customers to help them understand options on how to improve their application development practices on Azure.
