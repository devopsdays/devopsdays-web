I help enterprises become successful by adopting DevOps practices. In my spare time I'm an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin, ServerlessDays Austin, DevOpsDays Texas, the Austin AWS Users Meetup, and the Cloud Austin Meetup. When I'm not working or organizing you can catch me hiking around Austin and checking out our many local brewereies.
