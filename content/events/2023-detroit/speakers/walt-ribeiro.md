As the Senior Developer Advocate at Equinix, I help create video and written how-to guides, product demos, and reference materials. Having been a broadcast engineer at Youtube Space LA, I understand online content and production and am excited to bring that energy to Equinixâ€™s growing community across all sites, meetups, and events.
