Philips has transformed to become a focused health technology leader. From connected, smart oral care to informatics, precision diagnostics, and image-guided therapy solutions.

Typical of a multinational company of its size, portfolio complexity, global reach, and technology focus, Philips wanted to innovate its development strategy, which had spread the companyâ€™s code across a multitude of repositories and servers and made code discovery and reuse a significant challenge. Philips is creating a modern collaboration ecosystem and following InnerSource ways of working as default.

In this talk, we'll share our journey including:
- why and how Philips approaches InnerSource and the software development tooling ecosystem to improve developer experience and satisfaction.
- tips to achieve a developer centric experience, build internal communities and achieve collaboration while ensuring compliance on a regulated environment.

Of course not everything went well, and definitely not the first time, we will also share our lessons learnt as well as our current status and future plans.
