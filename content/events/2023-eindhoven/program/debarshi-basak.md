Collaboration between Developers, DevOps, and SRE is difficult without concrete infrastructure access management. Sharing credentials for VMs, Kubernetes, databases, etc. in a zero-trust, secure, and compliant way is painful and leaky. As compliance frameworks like SOC2, GDPR, and NIST 800-53 start becoming the norm in organizations, tools for auditable logical access management to software, infrastructure, etc. become very important.

We’ll use examples of some modern-day organizations we have spoken to and explain how they implement access, some breaking points, and some pitfalls in their implementation.

We will also showcase a new architecture for managing infrastructure access via containers, with simplified developer experience. You’ll leave with a concrete understanding of infrastructure access management and the benefits and tradeoffs of implementing it, enabling you to justify the investment.
