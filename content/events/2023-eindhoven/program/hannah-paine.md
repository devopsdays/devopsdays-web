When your job is to go into other (often large, bureaucratic, non-digital) businesses and work within their methods, tools and frameworks, how can you possibly have a positive DevEx as a consultant? Does DevEx always require investment of time and money into tooling to be successful?\n\nAs an engineering manager, a major part of my role is creating the environment for positive DevEx where we don't have control over the tools and processes our engineers use. In this talk, I will talk through the "peopley" bits of DevEx and how we can all be positive change makers to make for a brilliant shared developer experience.
