It might seem obvious to some, but behind the dutch railways is a very rich and complex IT landscape that supports it. A large part of that IT landscape, which consists of dozens of applications each supported by a separate team, runs on AWS. Each of these teams needs support, guidelines, a managed environment and an AWS account to function. This is the responsibility of the platform engineering team at NS. In this talk you will hear about how NS has decided do platform engineering on AWS. We will go over the what, why and how of our platform engineering strategy, including a deep dive on the topic of account provisioning in AWS.
