Our presentation will explore the diverse approaches we are implementing within ASML IT to stimulate a DevOps mindset and foster the adoption of various DevOps practices. We believe our insights will provide valuable learnings and inspiration to the DevOps community attending the DevOps Days.

In this talk, we will share our experiences, challenges, and successes at ASML IT as we embarked on a transformative journey of DevOps adoption. ASML is one of the well-known large organizations within the Netherlands and our DevOps transformation focused on ASML IT which consists of roughly over 200 teams. The presentation will focus on four pivotal areas that have been instrumental in our endeavours:
1. Pull vs. Push: Striking the Right Balance
We will delve into the importance of finding the right balance between pushing for DevOps practices and allowing teams to pull these practices willingly into their workflows. We will share our rationale and challenges we faced during this two-way approach which was designed to empower teams to take ownership of their DevOps journey, fostering greater collaboration and synergy across the organization.
2. Overcoming Change Fatigue: Nurturing Continuous Improvement
Change fatigue is a common obstacle during any transformation. We will discuss the challenges we faced due to change fatigue and strategies we are employing to overcome resistance to change and instil a culture of continuous improvement. 
3. Empowering Grassroot Adoption: Cultivating Collaboration and Ownership
The success of DevOps greatly relies on grassroots adoption. Our talk will highlight the significance of empowering individuals at all levels to actively contribute to the DevOps culture. We will share how we are nurturing a collaborative environment where everyone's ideas and efforts are valued, which can drive meaningful change from the bottom-up.
4. Strengthening Communities for Sustainable Growth
We recognize the importance of communities in supporting and sustaining DevOps practices. Our presentation will showcase how we are nurturing vibrant communities within ASML IT to share knowledge, best practices, and innovations. These communities play a key role in promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
