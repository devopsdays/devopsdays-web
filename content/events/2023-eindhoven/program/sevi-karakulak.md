In this talk, we will discuss the increasing importance of compliance, particularly in financial institutions, and the role of automation in this regard. We are going to have a look at the pain points of moving to the cloud if your company has a highly regulated environment, and I am going to be sharing some of our nerve-wracking security design experiences from our customer transformation journeys.

We will then discuss the ways of adopting a compliance-centric methodology, have a look at the frameworks and and tools and the questions we have to keep in mind moving along.
Then, I will unveil our latest passion project: an open-source solution designed to significantly enhance controls and audits.
