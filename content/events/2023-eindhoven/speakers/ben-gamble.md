Ben has spent over 10 years leading engineering in startups and high-growth companies. As a founder, a CTO, a producer and a product leader he's bridged the gap between research and product development. Having worked with the cutting edge of augmented reality, scaling 3D gaming, and same day logistics, heâ€™s no stranger to taking on technical challenges, and the commercial realities that entails. Having found a home in DevRel in recent times, Ben now works to make real-time data a reality for anyone who needs it with open source tools and shared ideas.
