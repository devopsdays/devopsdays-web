I'm a holistic system software engineer, PostgreSQL solution architect at EDB, air guitar player and headbanger. I got my PhD researching distributed self-managing systems and I have been working with PostgreSQL since version 9.1. In 2018 I started the PostgreSQL User Group in Belgium. I have presented in conferences in academia, open source, and Postgres. I think knowledge sharing is an important part of contributing to the open source community.
