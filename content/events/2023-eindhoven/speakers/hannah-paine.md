Having started in technical delivery with a big consultancy firm, Hannah soon found that her passion was in helping engineers find joy in their environment, even when they could not shape or control everything around them. She's now an engineering manager and fulfilling her love of growing and supporting engineers to delivery kick-ass products while being happy, healthy and hella productive. When not being interrupted by her cat on video calls, Hannah can be found in the mountains, come rain, snow and shine.
