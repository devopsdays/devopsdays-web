I am the lead DevOps (lead of the DevOps, SysOps and DBA team) of the Mobility Business and Mobility Connect website at TotalEnergies. I am also the FinOps manager for our cloud infrastructure.

I am also a Python developer with more than 10 years of experience. I also have 3 years of experience in Java programming.

My main focus nowadays is around DevOps, FinOps and DevSecOps: build pipelines, deployments, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Azure, AWS, ...

I am an open-source enthusiast. I am part of Homebrew's technical committee (the missing package manager for Mac (or Linux)): https://github.com/Homebrew/brew. I am also the lead maintainer of the pygccxml Python library. You can find me on GitHub: https://github.com/iMichka.

I have a PhD in Physics from the University of Lille 1. I speak French, German, English and Luxembourgish. I regularly run marathons (and sometimes even longer distances than that).
