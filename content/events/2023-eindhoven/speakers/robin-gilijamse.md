Robin is an Network Architect working with organizations to improve their network operations. This means not only implementing shiny new and innovative technology, but more importantly also leveling up the team by improving operational processes and increasing skill levels. This means showing rather than telling the right way forward, and also talking about all the mistakes he made to help others avoid those.

When he's not behind a computer, you might find Robin riding his bicycle through the Veluwe forests, or engaged in mock sword fights.
