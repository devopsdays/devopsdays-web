I am a Product Manager within Developer Experience department. I have been working at TomTom for the last 5 years. I have a broad focus which includes measuring and improving developer productivity, enabling engineers to deliver better software faster, by freeing them to focus on creating differentiating business value rather than fighting with tool chains and infrastructure. In terms of deliverables, you can think of things like reference CI and CD pipelines and provisioning APIs, as well as software delivery performance management such as Accelerate KPIs, improved focus on flow, and development analytics.
