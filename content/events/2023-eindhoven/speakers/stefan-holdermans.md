A Director of Software Solutions at Schuberg Philis, Stefan Holdermans has over two decades of experience of developing, delivering, and running custom software solutions. He considers himself a pragmatic Agilist, strongly believing that a process should always adapt itself to the needs of the team. As a result, he is consistently sceptical towards silver-bullet, one-size-fits-all solutions, especially if they are concerned with “scaling agile”.
