Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies and "proud nerd". Suzanne previously worked at Microsoft, Spotify (as a Developer Relations Lead for Backstage), and most recently Port.

Her passion is enabling developers and platform engineers get the tools and skills to do what they do best: creating, delivering and running the software this world runs on while trying to innovate and make sense of buzzwords.
