This talk will give an understanding of what it’s like when you can’t turn off your laptop and go home because you’re a dev, but also the ops and security team!

According to Forbes, most small businesses and CIOs feel unprepared to deal with an attack. This can be due to a lack of incident response experience, combined with small security budgets. This talk will take you on a journey that many devs in small (and sometimes medium) businesses face when they're under attack from malicious actors with little investment.

From poring through logs, feeling the ire of management wondering why things haven't been fixed yet, through to the high of pinpointing the problem, this session will equip you with a greater understanding of the harsh complexities involved and practical ways to reinforce your defences. As Benjamin Franklin once said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”
