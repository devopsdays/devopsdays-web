With 20 years of experience in building software, I worked within companies ranging from small start-ups to large enterprises helping them embrace Agile Technical Practices in London, Italy and Norway.

Adopting Agile methodologies, especially eXtreme Programming reshaped the way I build software and think about the whole lifecycle of solutions. I like concise, expressive, and readable code as well as pragmatically improving existing solutions.

I am passionate about developing and designing OO and functional code and leading digital transformations through cultural change and architectural evolution to scalable distributed asynchronous systems.

Being a continuous learner, I love to share my experience with others through coaching, mentoring, and delivering workshops and talks. In fact I spoke and run workshops in several european conferences like DDD Europe, KanDDDinsky, Devops Days Zurich 2021 and more.

I am the co-founder of Alcor Academy with the mission of helping technical leaders to promote a culture of excellence with our innovative socio-technical training.

I am also co-author of the multi-award-winning book "Agile Technical Practices Distilled".
