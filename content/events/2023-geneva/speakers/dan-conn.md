Dan Conn likes to sit in the point between cyber security and development and over the past 10 years has worked as a developer in small startups, large corporates and many in between, catering for clients both public and private sector from SME size to enterprise. 

He has also had a strong interest in cybersecurity for just as long culminating in a postgraduate certificate in Advanced Security and Digital Forensics.

Dan is now a Developer Advocate for Sonatype. When not coding, hacking, or talking about these things... you can find Dan running, skateboarding, DJing or making music!
