I describe myself as a software crafter, technical coach, international speaker, Systems thinker, symmathecist, philosopher - all mixed with some Venetian humor.


I am the co-author of the multi-award-winning book "Agile Technical Practices Distilled - A learning journey in technical practices and principles of software design".


I self-learned Basic on a Commodore when I was 9 and my passion for programming has never faded since. I have been working for the past 20 years between Italy and UK, embracing ideas from Lean, Agile, eXtreme Programming, Domain-Driven Design, and Systems Thinking.


I recently co-founded Alcor Academy with the mission of helping technical leaders to create a culture of engineering excellence through training on Agile Technical Practices.
