In 2016, I co-founded Avalia Systems, to apply my research on "software analytics" in industrial use cases. 

At the time, I was Professor at the HEIG-VD, in Yverdon-les-Bains and led the "Software Engineering Group". My co-founder lives in Switzerland but grew up in Brazil. This is why we started to do client projects there, and why more than half of our team is based there. I am lucky enough to spend time in Brazil, and I love working in this ecosystem.

I left HEIG-VD in mid-2021 (after 15 years) to work full-time at Avalia, where I serve as CTO. In my role, I am responsible for our IP portfolio, but I am also directly involved in client projects. I have been working on "developer tools" for many years, and this is the reason why I am very interested in platforms that support "developer experience" (hence Backstage)

While at HEIG-VD, I have been actively working in several startups, and leading teams, always with a hands-on approach. Before joining HEIG-VD, I worked for 6 years for Sun Microsystems. Before that, I did my Ph.D. at Hiroshima University, in Japan. And even before that, I studied Computer Science at the University of Fribourg.


Last but not least: not surprising for a former professor... but I LOVE to share knowledge and to give presentations :-).
