For all the work we're doing in the name of DevOps (and Agile, for that
matter), the results aren't what they should be.

You and your team have probably learned enough new processes, tools, and
techniques. Maybe you even have an expensive piece of paper that says
so. But if these aren’t quite clicking for you, you likely haven’t
*unlearned* the way you were taught to work before.

I'm going to put my finger on that, and on the thing we have to lose
faith in before we can get the results we're looking for.
