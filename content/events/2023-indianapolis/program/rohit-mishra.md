Build a software defined platform powered by Kubernetes which provides a
single interface for automating the management and provisioning of
resources across multiple cloud providers in a way which is native to
Kubernetes. Learn how to simplify and automate cloud infrastructure
management leveraging common concepts in Kubernetes such as custom
resources, operators (see the next section) and a control loop based
reconciliation. Combined with GitOps, you can achieve a 'continuous
delivery' model for your 'multi-cloud' infrastructure, all of it seen
through a single pane of glass, the 'Controlplane'!
