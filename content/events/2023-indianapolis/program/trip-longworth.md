Title = "The Wall of Awful: tactics for summiting your most mountainous molehills"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["trip-longworth"]
+++

This talk presents the concept of the Wall of Awful, a metaphor for
emotional barriers that keep us from doing the things we supposedly want
to do. We'll go over the neuroscience behind these blockers, why the
tactics we often try don't actually work, and what tactics you can use
to get past these barriers and to your goal.
