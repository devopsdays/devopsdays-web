Brian Sweeney started his career as a backend developer building query
and reporting tools for the retail and finance industries. His interests
drew him to software packaging and delivery just as on-prem cloud
options were exploding and public cloud adoption was taking off. That
led him down the stack to providing platform services and developer
experiences, helping teams pivot from VM-based workflows to containers
and orchestrators. These days, he works to increase the reliability of
platform infrastructure and empower users at a global bank. In his free
time, you can find him in the garden, assembling cat toys, or taking a
bit too much time making dinner.
