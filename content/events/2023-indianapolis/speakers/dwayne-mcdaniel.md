Dwayne McDaniel has been working as a Developer Relations professional
since 2015 and has been involved in the wider tech community since 2005.
He loves sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm about Git, Open Source
tools, and tech in general and he has done so at over a hundred events
all over the world. He has been fortunate enough to speak at
institutions like MIT, Stanford, and far-off places like Paris and
Iceland. You can see some of his past talks on Drupal.tv and
WordPress.tv.

Dwayne currently lives in Chicago, right beside Lake Michigan. Outside
of tech you might find him leading an event after-party to a Karaoke
spot or quietly knitting a new hat.
