Combining the principals of a Computer Science education with the
experience of working in the IT field for over 15 years has led me to
become a champion of automation and DevOps practices. The landscape of
technologies available to automate the myriad of tasks and operations
modern organizations perform has changed dramatically since I entered
the field, and I embrace them all. PowerShell, Bash, Python, C#, Puppet,
Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins...the tooling list abounds, and they all
have their place...unless its VBScript, in which case all bets are off.

If I am not taking a deep dive into the latest tech gadget or exploring
a new Chicago House musician, you'll likely find me playing a PC game,
with multiple cats chilling out nearby, desperately hoping for more food
(even though you've already been fed, kitties!).
