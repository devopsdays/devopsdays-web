Jon is a Full-Stack Nerd Coach, and has been in software development for
over twenty years. His professional mission is to help people unlearn
the hidden habits of the 20th century, so they can succeed in the work
of the 21st.

He holds a few certifications, but prefers books. *The Coaching Habit*,
*When Will it be Done*, and *Test-Driven Development by Example* are a
few that keep coming in handy.

These days, Jon is consulting and shipping better software sooner with
Industrial Logic. Whatever you do, donâ€™t follow @jonfazzaro on Twitter.
