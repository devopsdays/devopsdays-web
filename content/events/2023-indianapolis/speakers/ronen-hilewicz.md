Ronen Hilewicz is a principal software engineer at Aserto, where he
combines his passions for software security and clean architecture to
help engineers navigate the challenges of modern identity and access
management.

Most of his 25-year software career has revolved around large-scale and
highly available distributed systems in one way or another. At Microsoft
he was the engineering lead of the team that built the Azure Service
Bus, and has since gone back to his scrappy roots and worked in various
startups on distributed computation frameworks, big-data and
machine-learning services, and most recently, distributed authorization.

Based in Bloomington, IN since 2021, Ronen likes to spend his free time
playing bass and jamming with local musicians.
