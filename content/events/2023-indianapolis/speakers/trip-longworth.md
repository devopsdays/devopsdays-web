Trip is a rainbow-haired, queer devops nerd who doesn’t believe work has
to be as boring and painful as it currently is. They have held a variety
of devops roles in their career, including helping organize the Portland
DevOpsDays conference. When they’re not in front of their computer, they
like to sing karaoke, go trail running, and perform on the trapeze. They
have 2 cats, Dexter and Diego, who have taught them more about
boundaries than any human they’ve met.
