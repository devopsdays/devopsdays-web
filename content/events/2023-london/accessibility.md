At DevOpsDays London we're committed to removing barriers that would prevent anyone from accessing the event.

We will provide different coloured lanyards to indicate your willingness to be photographed, plus badge stickers to indicate if you want to talk to other attendees and pronoun stickers which we would like all attendees to use.

Additional facilities include gender neutral toilets and for those that need a break, we provide a quiet room.

## Live Captioning

As we've done previously, we'll be providing live captioning for those with hearing impairments along with live signing during the talks.

## Free Child Care Services

We will be providing free child care services during the event.

If you have any concerns regarding accessibility please contact the organising team and we will be happy to discuss the available assistance and to help you plan your travel. We are able to cover the costs of local transport to the venue if it would otherwise prohibit you attending.

Any requests for monetary assistance must be made in advance.
