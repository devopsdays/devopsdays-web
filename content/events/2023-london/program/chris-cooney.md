Ten years ago, Observability barely existed. Now, it costs 10-30% of operational budgets. Inefficient Observability has become THE blocker to a scaled DevOps strategy. In this talk, we'll explore the reasons why Observability is too damn expensive, and the drivers that have created our financial predicament. In the second part of the talk, we'll explore some of the antipatterns for cost optimization, and the architectural / technical approaches that teams can adopt to drive down their observability costs.
