Every tech and delivery consultant has experienced a developer friend saying, "You're a consultant - could you point out what we are doing wrong?". To me it happened when a friend who works in VR development asked me this question after a pint in a pub. This sent me on a mission on how to improve their operations by sprinkling a little bit of automation and DevOps tooling into their delivery cycle.
