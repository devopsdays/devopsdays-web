Tech Lead and Mental Health First Aider who specialises in Serverless and cloud-native. I have been a developer for 10 years and worked on many high throughput applications focusing on using best practices to ensure the applications can stand up to high public traffic. As a Serverless and Event-Driven enthusiast I spend my spare time keeping up with the latest technologies and patterns. I’m also a big football fan and try to watch as much football as possible.
