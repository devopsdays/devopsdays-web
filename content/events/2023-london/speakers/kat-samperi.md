Kat has been coding since she was 8 years old, and hated repeatedly typing the same thing, over and over, so that she could play specific levels of Doom.

Since then, Kat has achieved a PhD in AI and Robotics, followed by a drop into the world of DevSecOps and Automation. Working across various consultancies, government, energy and journalism, Kat has developed solid Build and Deployment pipelines over the years, with a keen focus on ensuring safety, security and reliability when releasing to production.

Her favourite dinosaur is the Triceratops.
