Lian always wanted to save the world. After attempting to become a lawyer, she decided to do something with computers instead. Working as a Fullstack Software Engineer, she got into attending tech events and giving talks on Machine Learning. During this time, she fell in love with the tech community and discovered her passion for building community and providing a safe and productive environment for all, which led to her co-organising the community conference ServerlessDays Amsterdam and DevOpsDays Amsterdam. Currently, Lian lives in Amsterdam and works as Developer Advocate at Loft Labs, helping to make developing on Kubernetes easy and fun. She is also the organiser of Kuberoke, the first and only Kubernetes Karaoke Community.
