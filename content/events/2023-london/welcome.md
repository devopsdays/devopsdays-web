      <h4 class="alert-heading">Coronavirus (COVID-19) information.</h4>
      <p>For this year’s event, we’ll be implementing the following safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We encourage all attendees to wear masks and engage in social distancing in all enclosed spaces throughout the venue. To guarantee entry, we will require a negative lateral flow test completed on the same day. These measures will be reviewed and updated to reflect the changing situation and number of cases as we approach the date of the conference.</p>

    <p>The first DevOpsDays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. Since then, DevOpsDays events have multiplied and expanded globally with over 50 events in 2022.</p>
    <p>DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from community, for the benefit of the community.
      We are not a commercial conference and we believe that our focus on serving the community creates a truly unique experience for both delegates and sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>We expect 350 people (depending on COVID-19 guidance) this year and will be holding the event on September 21st-22nd at the QEII Centre in London..</p>
    <p>The format of DevOpsDays London includes a single track of 30 minute talks in the morning of each event, followed by Ignite talks (5 minute, auto forwarding). We spend the rest of the afternoon in Open Spaces, which are considered a key portion of the event.
