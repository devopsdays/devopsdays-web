Keeping on top of your organizationâ€™s technical platforms as well as customer experience is a daunting task, and it can't be done by siloed teams. Your Customer Service team and the insight they gain from users is critical to the incident identification and response process, and your development teams can use this insight as data to speed up their ability to resolve the problem. As the team closest to the customer, incorporating your customer service team into the DevOps lifecycle will reduce silos, shorten feedback loops, empower agents, grow careers and delight your customers.

Come to this session to learn about bringing customer service teams in line with development teams, organizational goals, and improving agent experience to improve the customer experience. In this talk, you will learn the importance of aligned customer service ops, and how to help your customer service and dev teams establish strong practices of collaboration as one team in service of your customers.
