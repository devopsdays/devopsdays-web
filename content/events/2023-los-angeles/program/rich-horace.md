DevOps means different things to different people. Is DevOps a philosophy or methodology or practices? Should there even be a DevOps Team or even a Job Title. Hey, What about Culture? DevOps is not one size fits all. DevOps is a journey that should evolve to meet the business needs.Throughout my career, I have always worn some type of operations hat from Help Desk, System Administration to Sr Director of DevOps. A common thread within all these roles has been how to get ops involved sooner, not only become part of the process, but became the secret sauce of the organization.In this talk, I will share my experiences that have shaped my approach to DevOps. The journey to move Ops to the left (and challenges to keep left in Agile environments).
