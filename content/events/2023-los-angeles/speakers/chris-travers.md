Chris Travers has over twenty years of experience working with PostgreSQL as an application developer, database administrator and engineer, and IT manager. He has worked with (and overseen teams which worked with) petabyte-scale implementations of PostgreSQL often replacing technologies like Elastic Search when scalability limits were reached there.

At Adjust, Chris oversaw teams supporting the infrastructure and data management platforms that supported 700k requests a second and data environments storing over ten petabytes of data at high velocity. He has also worked as a principal engineer at Delivery Hero, and at several other firms.
