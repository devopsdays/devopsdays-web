SecretSauceOps

Rich has had the fortune to work for great organizations and with even better people throughout his career. He was an early-adopter of DevOps recognizing the opportunity to move Ops out from under just being a cost-center to a key contributor to help companies accelerate business objectives. A majority of his career has been building data-driven DevOps teams for SaaS in the online advertising space (Nativo, Fox, MySpace), but also has held roles within Corporate IT (Nestle and EMC). He has a passion for automation, observability and monitoring systems. He has been an Elastic Community Leader and organizer for the Elastic LA Meetup since 2015.
