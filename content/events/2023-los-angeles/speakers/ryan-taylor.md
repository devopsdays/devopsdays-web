I have over 15 years of experience leading Technical Operations teams with some of the most respected companies in streaming media, finance, and security technology. In 2021, I joined Transposit as Head of Product to provide thought leadership and strategy to build a product that fulfills the needs of our customers, employees, partners and rewards our stakeholders. I am an Ex-Hulugan, Director of Production Operations. My teams maximized uptime/availability for our Live and Video on Demand products leveraging operators, a talented engineering team, and the analytical tools built by those teams. I am a frequent speaker, consultant, and colleague to those in the technical operations field. In my experience, communication and shared goals have lowered the drawbridges of impenetrable castles. The resulting relationships and experiences have led my teams to create and operate some of the most efficient tech platforms.
