##### TALK ABSTRACT

**Serverless @ 30k feet**

The idea of the talk is to share about the Tech side of Ryanair, the key points about why we are Serverless 1st and the route to here.

To show some of the use cases and the AWS Serverless resources and how they help us with our Biz requirements.

I want to tell you the PROS and CONS of Serverless architectures we have found on the trip, What tools and How we choose between both architectures at Ryanair and why the critical thing is flexible enough to easily move between them.
