##### TALK ABSTRACT

To help people transform organizations, there’s a need to help others see the gap between where they currently are and what’s needed. Oftentimes, we think we’re in the right place, or at least headed in the right direction, when we’re really somewhere else. Making work more visible helps people see the light to find a way through the change curve.

Changing how you work isn't easy if you’re not set up for and organized for change. This talk covers five things that you can do to better equip yourself and your team for a greater chance of successful transformation. We will dive into various dimensions of increased visibility based on examples from real companies - including work type distribution, units of customer value delivered, neglected work, and Ops reviews. This talk will help you gain a better understanding of what it really takes to implement change.
