##### TALK ABSTRACT


Our long journey into replacing our current search index in Solr answering 2 million queries daily with minimal disruption and loss. Our most embarrassing moments and proudest successes and some thoughts on how we could have done it better.

We had an old version of Solr installed on an on premise Linux machine that we wanted to upgrade and also move to Azure. The upgrading was a whole journey of itself, but the testing, deploying and setup is what I'll be focusing on.
