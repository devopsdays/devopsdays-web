##### TALK ABSTRACT

*Have you ever struggled to release new versions of your application in a multicluster environment?* *How do you know that the new version of your application will work as expected and will give a great experience to the end user?*

By using CI/CD to deploy the new version across all clusters, advanced deployment capabilities and progressive delivery features to release a new version of an application without affecting the end user. 

We will achieve this in a Multicluster Service Mesh environment with the help of **Istio**, **ArgoCD** and **Argo Rollouts**.
