##### TALK ABSTRACT

**The challenges of Platform teams (and few tips & tricks to overcome them)**

User-centricity, consistency, simplicity, usability, continuous business value delivery, product alignment with business vision-mission and goals... All these pillars build the foundation of successful products and innovative product organisations. 
However, we face major challenges when translating Product Thinking to Platforms and when applying Agile and SW development practices in Platform teams.  In this talk, we will review together these challenges and how we can overcome them.
