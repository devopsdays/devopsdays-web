##### TALK ABSTRACT

Today we are going to build a fully operational internal developer platform or IDP in a way that can meet almost anyone's needs. To make it more challenging, we'll do that in 30 minutes or less.

Now, you might be thinking that we cannot do much in such a short period, but you're wrong. We'll create an IDP in a way that any expert can "plug" their experience into the platform (e.g., cluster, DB, application, etc.) so that anyone else can consume it as a service without having deep experience with it.

To accomplish our goal, we'll create a control plane using Crossplane, user-friendly interfaces with Compositions, Web UI with Port, synchronization with GitOps backed by Argo CD, DB schema management with SchemaHero, secrets management with External Secrets, policies with Kyverno, and one-shot actions with pipelines backed by GitHub Actions.

P.S. I was told that cheating is wrong only if you get caught so I might resort to some dirty tricks to meet the deadline.
