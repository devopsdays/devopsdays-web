CTO and co-founder of Audiense
In 2000, during my second year of Computer Science studies in Cuba, I developed an e-learning platform that eventually came to be utilized by the majority of Cuban universities. In 2007, I relocated to Spain to conduct research at the University of CÃ³rdoba. A few years later, I wrote the initial lines of code for what is now known as Audiense. Since then, I've transitioned from software development to team management.
