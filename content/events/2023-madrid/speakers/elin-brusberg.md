Worked as a developer for many years, spent the last 4 years rebuilding the backend team in 1881. Not a lot of time left for coding now, but I am still very much involved in the technical solutions. I spend most of my days supporting the team and working long term on our technical and resource strategy. On occasions lucky to share my experience with a wider audience, such as this.
