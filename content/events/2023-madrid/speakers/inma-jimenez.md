I started a degree in Psychology at the University of Salamanca. After 3 years there, I decided to finish it in Madrid. The main reason was that I wanted to specialise in Organizational Psychology to discover more about the role of a psychologist in a company, and the colleges of Madrid offered this choice to me.

I completely fell in love with Organizational Psychology and HR. So, when I finished my degree, I studied for a Master's in Human Resource Management to increase my knowledge in this field.

I continue learning and improving my skills through Technology and HR Analytics trainings.

Currently, I work at Nexthink as Technical Recruiter. Nexthink is a software solution that improves the digital employee experience at their workplace day to day.

Here, I'm focused on supporting the teams to find the best talent and helping people to engage in a challenging projects where they improve their skills and knowledge.

If you want to challenge yourself with a new goal, you know, maybe we should talk ;) Do you dare?
