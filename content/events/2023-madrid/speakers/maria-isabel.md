I am an individual immensely passionate about Technology, especially about Platforms. I started my career working in a platform team building the core of CASTOR at CERN, the largest file system at the time. Ever since, my career has been nearly always linked to platform world. I now work as Technical Product Manager at Thoughtworks, helping teams to bring Product Thinking to the Platform space.
