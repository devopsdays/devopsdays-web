Buildpacks have been around for more than 10 years!
First they were used to detect and build an app before deploying it to a couple of PaaS.
Then we could create Docker (OCI) images with their latest generation, Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNCF incubating).
Are they a good alternative to the Dockerfile?
What are Paketo buildpacks ? Which community is supporting them and how?
Come and find out during this session that will feature demos along the way!
