Description
This talk uses the world of ballet to explain the complex field of distributed computing in a fun and accessible way. The talk explores how concepts of ensemble, pas de deux, choreography, grand jeté, adagio, and tutu can be used to explain different aspects of distributed computing. The speaker draws parallels between the precision and coordination required of ballet dancers and the precision and coordination required of devices working together in distributed computing. By using relatable and engaging metaphors, the speaker breaks down complex computing concepts and makes them more accessible to a broader audience.

Notes and comments
Distributed computing is a field of computer science that deals with distributed systems composed of multiple computers that work together to solve a problem.
The concepts of ensemble, pas de deux, choreography, grand jeté, adagio, and tutu can be used to explain different aspects of distributed computing.
Ensembles, just like ballet ensembles, require each device to have its own role and be an essential part of the group.
In pas de deux, just like in computing, it is important to split the task correctly to ensure that each device performs its role and contributes to the group's overall performance.
The choreography of devices working together is just as important as dancers working together to perform a task.
Grand jeté in ballet and grand jeté in computing require a lot of power and energy.
In adagio, both in ballet and computing, precision and accuracy are key.
Tutu in ballet and tutu in computing refer to the user interface or front-end that is used to interact with the distributed system.
By using relatable and engaging metaphors like ballet terms, the topic of distributed computing can be made more accessible and interesting to a broader audience.

These key takeaways can help individuals with a general interest in computer science or technology better understand the complex topic of distributed computing in a unique and engaging way.
