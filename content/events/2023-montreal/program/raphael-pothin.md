Being now able to build amazing apps on my own, directly in Production to improve business processes thanks to low-code platforms, I don't see why I should care about DevOps principles... Or should I? It is true that low-code platforms enable to deliver value quickly and easily but DevOps principles exist for good reasons, and some low-code developers will perhaps learn this lesson in a hard way.
