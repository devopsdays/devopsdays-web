Marisa had an exciting path that led her to Developer Advocacy. With a background in theoretical and computational physical chemistry, she's run experiments at particle accelerators worldwide. But after finishing her Ph.D., she moved into industry. As Streamlit's first developer advocate, she worked on initiatives throughout the company. After Streamlit's acquisition by Snowflake, she moved on to other opportunities and found Shipyard. She has a passion for learning and teaching others. She has been lucky enough to present at several webinars and conferences, ranging in topics from python, deployment, physics and chemistry.
