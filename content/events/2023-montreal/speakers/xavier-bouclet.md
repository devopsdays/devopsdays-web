Xavier is a developer with a 16+ years experience consulting for many different customers in France and Canada.

I like to work with Java or Kotlin in a Jakarta EE or Spring Boot context.

I am interested in stuff around DevOps, CI/CD, Testing, Security, ...

Most of all, I like to talk about tech stuff around a beer mostly during our Montreal Jug where I am a co-organizer.

On the personal side, I have three boys and a wife. They are my number one priority. And to have energy to do that, I run a lot.
