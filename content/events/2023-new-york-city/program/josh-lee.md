In this talk, I'll be sharing my insights and experiences with OpenTelemetry, an open source project that offers protocols, APIs, and SDKs for collecting metrics, traces, and logs from applications and services. I will cover the tools provided by the OpenTelemetry Community, including the Language SDKs, the Collector, and the OTLP formats for Metrics, Traces, and Logs.

I'll demonstrate how to instrument and observe a microservices application running on a Kubernetes cluster, utilizing the resources that OpenTelemetry has to offer. By the end of the presentation, you will have a deeper understanding of how to use open source tools like Jaeger and Prometheus to analyze the telemetry signals from your application.

Join me as I delve into the fascinating world of OpenTelemetry, sharing my knowledge and expertise to help you make the most of this powerful technology in your own projects.
