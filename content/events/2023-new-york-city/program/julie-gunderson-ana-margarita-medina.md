We spend all day thinking about our technical systems, but we often neglect the needs of our human systems. Ana and Julie will walk attendees through the principles of system reliability and how to not only apply them to their systems but their personal life to prevent burnout and enjoy their weekends more.

In this talk, attendees will learn how to apply incident response and blameless practices into their everyday activities. Attendees will also walk away knowing how to build reliable socio-technical systems and some tips to apply them to the workplace.
