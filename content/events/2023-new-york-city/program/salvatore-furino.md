As a Customer Reliability Engineer I've witnessed many organizations encounter stumbling blocks while attempting to implement SLOs. This talk will discuss 9 of the common issues that are encountered while attempting to implement SLOs and how to get the most value out of the SLOs you create.

- Measure meaningful things
- Raw data for Latency SLOs
- Success rates > Error rates
- Examine historical performance
- Define and take actions
- Different time windows for different folks
- Enrich your dashboards with context
- Document your SLOs
- Adopt open standards
