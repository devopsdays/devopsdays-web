Whether it’s operators or observability, agile or accessibility, my expertise shines because I’m passionate about all of it. I’ve been building software (and speaking about it) for more than a decade. I’m currently a Developer Advocate for Instana where I help create educational content about observability, and I am a contributor to the OpenTelemetry project.
