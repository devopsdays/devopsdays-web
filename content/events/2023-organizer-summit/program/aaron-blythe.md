After my first year as an organizer of a DevOpsDays in my local area, I reflected on what was good and what could be better. How could I codify a zero dollar agreement with that each organizer and speaker would need to abide by? Would it matter if people agreed to be cool, if everyone's idea of being cool is different? I'd like to discuss how that went over the next several years and submit it for others to use if they would like.
