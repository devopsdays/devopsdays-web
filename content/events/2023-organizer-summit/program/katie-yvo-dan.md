DevOpsDays are decentralised events, but there exists a core team of active organisers who are here to help you. Presented by your current co-chairs, this talk will illuminate some of the behind-the-scenes work that the DevOpsDays active core organisers do to help make sure all events are successful. You'll come away with a deeper understanding of how DevOpsDays itself is run, how Core helps, and how you can get involved with the meta organisation of events!
