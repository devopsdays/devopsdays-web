Title = "A (Quick) Deep Dive Into The DevOpsDays Website"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["matty-stratton"]
+++
The point of this talk is to provide some insight and tips into:

a) features of the devopsdays website you can use as an organizer that you might not know about and<br>
b) give a little technical background into some of the idiosyncrasies of the siteâ€™s technology (pipeline, etc).

Hopefully this will help organizers we able to better use the site for their events, and also maybe generate some Open Space conversation on how to improve the site overall!
