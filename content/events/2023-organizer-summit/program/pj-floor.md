Despite having run online events during the pandemic, or participating in online events, we struggle to give hybrid the attention it requires when it unlocks a whole new/different audience that for whatever valid reasons can't make it to your in-person event. You don't have to go full HashiConf either on your first try.

We would like to present a hybrid maturity model almost, and show events how they can accomodate for a remote audience, with the different levels of input and output.
