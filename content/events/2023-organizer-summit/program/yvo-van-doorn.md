Sometime in 2022 I did some math in how much devopsdays Amsterdam has spent on Eventbrite over the last decade. The amount was staggering! When factoring the 4% payment transaction plus €0.99 per ticket, they have made more than €130k over ten years. We can do better!

*Introducing Pretix for devopsdays events.*

In my talk I want to introduce all the organizers to Pretix and that going forward they can have their city utilize the instance already setup.
