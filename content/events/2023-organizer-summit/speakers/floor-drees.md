I'm a Staff Community Program Manager at Aiven, we manage your favorite open source data tools without exploiting the projects and their maintainers. Previously I worked in DevRel at Grafana Labs and Microsoft. I'm a Devopsdays Core member, and organize the Devopsdays Amsterdam and Eindhoven conferences. I'm a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies, and I organize a bunch of meetups. Crazy chicken lady.
