Laura Santamaria, a lead developer advocate at Dell Technologies, is one of the new core organizers for DevOpsDays Austin; was one of the organizers for the virtual DevOpsDays Texas during the pandemic; is a co-organizer for Cloud Austin, a large local meetup group in Austin; and was a co-organizer for Austin DevOps, Docker Austin, and more. Outside of tech, Laura runs (slowly), plays with her dogs, and watches cloudsâ€”the real kind.
