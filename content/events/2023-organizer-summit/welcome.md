The devopsdays Organizer Summit 2023 is a one-day event for organizers of devopsdays events. It is a chance to meet other organizers, share ideas, and learn from each other. It takes place the day before [devopsdays Chicago](https://devopsdays.org/chicago), and the ticket is a free add-on to registration for that event.

We will spend the day with short talks from other organizers, Open Spaces, and more!

Virtual attendance is available for those who cannot attend in person.
