This talk will go through basic tenants to utilize for DevOps to achieve ultimate performance and ease of use. We will start by identifying the process, looking for bottlenecks and opportunities for increased efficiency. The DevOps process we will use will be based on a pizza delivery service. The scenarios to illustrate the principles will be based on the pizza order, ingredients from suppliers (beware of ingredients gone bad), changes to orders, baking, packing, and delivery. Evaluation of the current process, and opportunities for improvement will be corollated to modern day software application development. Bon appetit!
