Power BI is a powerful visual development tool and most of itâ€™s features are really intutitve, with one of the exceptions being source control integration. In this session you will see how creating a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in Power BI is possible with the Azure DevOps. In this session we will review how to implement it using Power BI APIs and the Azure DevOps extension. We will walk through examples to provide attendees the information they need to add Power BI to CI/CD process used for other coding environments. See how you can automate assigning workspaces, adding users and managing deployments, and creating and editing pipelines. We will also review the Power BI licensing options to use this deployment and the options associated with each.
