The talk briefly discusses how Agile, DevOps, and Remote work have shaped the manner in which technical and operational teams work together, and calls attention to proven technology models - ChatOps and tightly-integrated tool ecosystems - as crucial elements for an effective, strategic DevOps practice. Practical, functional, easy-to-implement role-based examples are described as part of the narrative, which can be accomplished with a variety of solutions and most common software development stacks.
