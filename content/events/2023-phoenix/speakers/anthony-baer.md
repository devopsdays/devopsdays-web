Hi, I am a San Francisco resident and transplant from Southern California where I have held a multitude of positions within the DevOps space. My resume includes positions at IBM, Rational, GitLab, Sonatype, Delta Dental, and Value Health Sciences. Security and Quality are precious to me as goals to achieve with any application. I like to play guitar as a hobby and travel to concerts in different places of the United States. I also have a motorcycle that I take a 1500 ish mile weekend ride in the fall every year. I have participated in the Rosarito Ensenada Fun Bicycle ride about 20 times. I have a friend in the wine business who I have known since I was two years old. A bit of trivia - I won $1,800 on a game show. Ask me about other fun facts.
