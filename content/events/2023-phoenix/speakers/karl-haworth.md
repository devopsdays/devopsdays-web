Karl Haworth is a Architect within the Developer Accelerator space at American Airlines where he works on Developer Experience, including the Backstage implementation, DevOps, and Kubernetes related items to empower engineers to deliver functionality sooner through platform engineering. Fresh challenges and new technical perspectives excite me! When I am not enjoying the technology subreddits, I enjoy the outdoors through water activities and in the winter I love to downhill ski. When heads down, I enjoy the works of Ludovico Einadui with his minimalistic and modern twist to classical piano styles.
