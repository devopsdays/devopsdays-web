During the talk, you will learn how to build an AI chatbot in Langchain. 

You will get familiar with Langchain Agents and use them to give AI access to databases, documents, or APIs.
The example chatbot will search for relevant information in a database and answer user's questions using the retrieved data.

Additionally, you will learn how to preserve the conversation history between API calls and deploy the chatbot as a REST service.
