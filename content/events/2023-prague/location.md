<p>The conference will take place at the Clarion Congress Hotel</p>
<p>Freyova 33<br />
190 00, Praha 9</p>

<p>
The venue is directly above a subway station (Vysocanska - yellow B line) so we recommend using public transport to get there.<br />
If you need to take a car you may use parking in Fenix Shoppng Center - first 3 hours for free, after that 50 CZK/hour. Alternatively you can use the streets around for 30 CZK/hour.

<p>
The venue is wheelchair accessible and we'd be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs upon request: {{< email_organizers >}}.
