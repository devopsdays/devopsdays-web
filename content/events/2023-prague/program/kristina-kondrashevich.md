We work in IoT organization in Home Appliance Industry, and we scaled from 10 to 200 developers with 5 Ops engineers in 3 years. Our developers today can push code from day 1 with minimum knowledge of infrastructure. We are going to tell you how we built our IDP with integration to our Cloud and different toolchains, and how we embed SRE principles into this IDP.
