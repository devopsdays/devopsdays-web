In an increasingly unpredictable world, predictable software development and deployment methodologies are losing their value quickly. To maintain relevancy, so-called DevOps teams need to learn to understand what actually matters: accelerating their organizationâ€™s value hypothesis testing loop.

In this talk, Piet will explain how teams can move from slow, predictable, and losing to agile, competitive, and winning. The trick: learning to stop worrying about craftsmanship and embracing paradigms like AI pair programming, software-as-actual-code, low-code development platforms, and serverless.
