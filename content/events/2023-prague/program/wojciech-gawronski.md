As we live in the highly-connected, competitive, and more frequently unpredictable world, we know that flexibility and scaling capabilities of software systems require treating cloud as the new normal. That's why being modern applications are built with cloud in mind - treating it as a native environment.

At the same time, in IT, we pay attention to our craft - because we know that the quality of design and implementation affects everything that comes later. When building digital products, we treat this topic carefully - as we aim that our applications will be maintained for a much longer, in comparison to the software development phase.

As both worlds are extremely important, many projects often treat them as disconnected - even claiming that they are adopting DevOps, SRE, or Cloud Native approaches. In this talk, you will see a practical connection of both sides. You will see why taking care about quality at the foundational level of your software systems enables certain characteristics, that are determining if your application is designed in a modern and cloud native way - but more importantly, you will see how to do it.
