My name is Jakub Sekera. In 2020 I completed my Masters Degree in Computer Secuity at Czech Technical University (Faculty of Information Technology). In December 2017, I gained employment with Cisco in the position of Systems Engineer. Within 3 years I was promoted to a position within Cisco's DevOps Team. My position puts me in contact, with AWS, Splunk and Python on a daily basis.

I am an avid sports fan and participant. Currently, I am actively involved in floorball, I also have a particular interest in NHL and NFL. I have a passion for travel, cycling, and enjoy geocaching whenever I get the chance.
