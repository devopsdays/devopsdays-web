Title = "The Power of AArch64/ARM64: How Changing Server Architecture Can Help Combat Climate Change Today"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["aaron-williams"]

Data centers are consuming an unsustainable amount of energy, accounting for 6% of all US power generation in 2019. While x86 processors have been the go-to choice, energy efficiency has only recently become a priority for producers. This transition is slow and years away. The solution is easier than you think: switching to AArch64/ARM64 servers can reduce energy consumption in data centers today. This talk explores the benefits of this architecture and its potential to help combat climate change.
