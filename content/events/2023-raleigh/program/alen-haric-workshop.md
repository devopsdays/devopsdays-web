Title = "Workshop: Multi-Cluster Failover Using a Service Mesh"

Failover across clusters is a great way to improve the overall uptime and reliability of Kubernetes applications. While whole-cluster failover can be accomplished at the global ingress layer, failing over individual services is a little more difficult. In this session, weâ€™ll demonstrate traffic failover for individual services across clusters using Linkerd, the CNCF graduated service mesh. Attendees will learn how to combine service mesh metrics, traffic shifting, and cross-cluster communication in a cohesive and automated way, preserving security while using only open-source tools.
