Title = "Event Driven CI/CT/CD Framework with an Audit Trail"
Type = "talk"

+++

A lightning talk I did at one of our internal unconferences to kick off the new
event driven CI/CT/CD framework I was designing to bolt onto and expand our
current pipeline. As part of the design there is an audit trail of receipts that
are used to track what was done and trigger events. The talk should lead to a
greater discussion around the how and why to go event driven. Listeners should
come away thinking about ways to gate releases by readiness, drive automated
testing, make their pipelines asynchronous, and use machine learning to make the
pipeline leaner and more reliable.
