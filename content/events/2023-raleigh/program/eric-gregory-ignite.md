Title = "Large Scale, Small Footprint: Reducing Energy Consumption Programmatically with Cluster API"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["eric-gregory"]
+++

According to the CNCF’s Working Group for Environmental Sustainability, data centers currently utilize 2% of the world’s energy, with that number projected to grow to 12% by 2040.

As a resource-aware substrate for containerized workloads, Kubernetes is well-suited for building more sustainable cloud infrastructure. This talk will explore how Cluster API can be used to programmatically provision Kubernetes clusters for reduced environmental impact—including a proof-of-concept application for assessing emissions impact and provisioning clusters accordingly, using Cluster API and data from Cloud Carbon Footprint.
