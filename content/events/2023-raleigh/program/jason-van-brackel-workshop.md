In this hands-on workshop participants will learn about the fundamentals Kubernetes and managing an air gapped Kubernetes cluster, with open-source tooling.

They will use individual demonstration environments to
•        Setup a Kubernetes instance.
•        Prepare the Kubernetes instance for air gapped management
•        Package an existing application into containers
•        Create manifests and payloads required to deploy to the application to Kubernetes
•        Deploy the Application
•        Explore the application and Kubernetes components

No prior knowledge of containerized applications is expected as concepts will be explored though out the hands-on workshop.
