Title = "Sharpen that Edge! How a Service Mesh enhances EdgeComputeOps"
Type = "talk"

Sometimes you go all in on the cloud, and sometimes, you need to sharpen that Edge a bit.

When pursuing Edge Computing, some of the largest considerations for adoption are:
- Ease of deployment
- Zero-trust security posture
- Resource allocation and consumption
- Telemetry and Observability
- Latency and application response times

Large enterprises in heavily regulated industries or the public sector must adopt practices like a zero-trust security posture both inside and at the edge of its application networks. They must simultaneously be able to determine application performance through telemetry, and mitigate issues.

What's the right approach to meeting these conditions?

Enter the Istio Ambient Service Mesh, the perfect vehicle for meeting these challenges!

In this talk we'll dive into how Ambient offers a revolutionary data-plane architecture for Edge Computing using a live demonstration of the technology.

We'll use this to discuss how this allows service mesh users to deploy an enhanced security posture while slashing operational complexity and enabling incremental mesh adoption, all while reducing cost and computational overhead within a service mesh.
