Many modern applications rely heavily on open-source libraries from third parties. These libraries can help us develop software more quickly by providing pre-written code that we can use in our own projects. However, it's important to be careful when using open-source libraries, as poor management of third-party code can lead to vulnerabilities in our applications. In this session, we will examine the extent to which open-source libraries are used in our applications and identify common issues with third-party management in typical application security programs. We will also discuss best practices for effectively managing third-party code in order to ensure the security of our applications.
