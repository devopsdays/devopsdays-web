The use of database source control is a practice that's been around for a long time, but is difficult for many teams.

In this workshop, we'll start with the fundamentals of database source control, walking through some of the available tools, paradigms, and mistakes to avoid. However, the meat of the workshop will be working through advanced use cases for mature teams who want to take rapid development of transactional databases to the next level. We'll utilize containers, testing, and automated pipelines to make each deployment of your systems simple and sublime!
