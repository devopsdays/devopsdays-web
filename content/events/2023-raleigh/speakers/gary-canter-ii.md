Gary has spent the past 10 years as an IT and Cloud Architect Professional working in compliance heavy industries. Currently he’s the Technical Lead for a $55 Million program that builds, maintains, and provides a Platform as a Service (Paas) and Software as a Service (SaaS) on air-gapped, secured networks. This role has provided him the opportunity to use automation to fully deploy production, compliant, enterprise networks.  His career has covered the full lifecycle: starting as a Tier 1 Helpdesk and moving through the gauntlet to System Administration then finally to Cloud Architect. He has substantial experience in systems administration for SaaS, security compliance, and cloud engineering.  With that experience and his role now, he’s able to guide and implement automation not just for the technology but for the processes surrounding the technology.
