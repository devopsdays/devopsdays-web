Jeremy is the Co-Founder & CTO of Allstacks. He is a software developer with a background in computer vision and a passion for creating and building things. Jeremy has more than 10 years of engineering, leadership and entrepreneurship experience. He offers his internal team and clients a wealth of knowledge on how to improve technical and business efficiencies.


After years in engineering and executive roles, Jeremy saw a common thread among organizations; most companies lack the ability to synthesize their engineering and product data to understand where their efforts stand. He has made it his mission to help leaders collect the right data and visualize how well teams are tracking against company-wide efforts so they can take action on that data.


Before co-founding Allstacks, he was an adjunct teacher at Wake Technical Community College where he designed a web development boot camp course. Jeremy previously worked as a CTO for Ravioli Labs and he was Director of Research and Engineering at CertiRx.


He received a degree in computer science from North Carolina State and he currently lives with his wife and a newborn baby in Cary, NC.
