DevOps / Cloud / Platform Engineer who likes finding simple solutions. I am passionate about effective communication and strongly believe in "everything as code".

I enjoy DevOps (especially DevEx) and leadership roles because I love enabling people to do their best work.

I have worked in a couple different kinds of DevOps roles, which were sometimes great, other times could be described by Team Topologies DevOps Anti-Types (web.devopstopologies.com). So I have seen a couple different ways of doing things.

Outside the office, I like to spend time with my family, play games, read/listen to books and podcasts, and I am learning jazz piano.
