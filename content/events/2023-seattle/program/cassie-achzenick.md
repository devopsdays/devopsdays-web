Title = "Too Hangry to Learn: What I Know About How Scaffolding and Productive Struggle"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["cassie-achzenick"]
+++

My path to tech was a winding one that led me through several opportunities to teach in formal and informal settings. When I did a bootcamp and started working in the industry, I realized that as technologists, we don't teach teaching.
In this talk I am going to cover concepts like scaffolding and productive struggle, and how we can use these concepts to understand onboarding new teammates. It's not as straightforward as it seems -- it depends on the person, how hungry they are, whether they're stressed about something else, what time of day it is, and a thousand other factors. Come to this talk to learn how to think through your approaches and make teaching and onboarding a conversation, instead of an infodump.
