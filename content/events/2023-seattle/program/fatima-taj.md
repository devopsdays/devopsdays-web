You’re starting your first tech job tomorrow, and you’re a bundle of nerves. You’ve been taught the technical basics in school, but how do you navigate the early days at a new workplace? After all, working in the industry isn’t as straightforward as in the classroom; it’s no longer about attending classes and writing exams. This territory feels unfamiliar to most of us because we’re not taught how best to approach the early days at a new job. This presentation addresses those early days as a recent graduate, where one can feel very lost and uncertain, with tips to start making meaningful contributions, creating a great first impression, and setting yourself up for long-term success!
