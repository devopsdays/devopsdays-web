Itâ€™s all about the customer. In this session, I will use real-world scenarios to discuss the importance of SLOs to help us set actionable business goals, measure them, and stay on target.

We will deep-dive into the difference between monitoring and observability, how the SLOs have changed the observability business, and why SLO is the MVP of observability. We will also discuss how to leverage the error budget to help us prioritize our investment, and positive impact opportunities that go beyond the baselines, and balance our roadmap toward the business goals.
