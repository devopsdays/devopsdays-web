It is very easy to take computers for granted. When the system is down, we get called upon to fix it; but it is rare to get acknowledgement for the absence of incidents.
However, it is exactly the successful maintenance of reliable computing infrastructure that is the majority of DevOps work, and it is often invisible.

Of course, DevOps is not unique in this. There are many areas of work and life that rely on “everything else” running smoothly.

This talk will explore why these maintenance tasks are so often not appreciated. Looking at the parallels between daily life and keeping the computers happy, we will look at how we learned our best practices, take pride in our skill set, and aim to arrive at a place of confidence from where we can claim and name what DevOps brings to the table.
