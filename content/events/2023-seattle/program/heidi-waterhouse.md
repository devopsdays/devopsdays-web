A whirlwind tour of the evolution of kitchens from Victorian caverns to domestic economy, and what that transition can teach us about the very real value of code ergonomics. This talk is based on Lillian Gilbreth's domestic research and revolutions, and applies to the very screen you are looking at right now. Come for the iceboxes, apply science to your IDEs.
