There are a lot of 101 primers on building Kubernetes services but there is a lot more to learn before these services are hardened and are production grade. This session will talk about architecting production grade services, CICD workflow, deployment examples and finally how to monitor services in production , what alerts to set up and how to troubleshoot and rollback.
