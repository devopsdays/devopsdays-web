Change is a constant in our professional lives, and it can be both exhilarating and daunting. Whether it's a re-org, being laid off, or starting an expanded role, career transitions can be challenging. However, these transitions can also bring exciting new opportunities and a chance for growth.

In this talk, I will share my personal experiences of navigating through different career transitions and how I learned to embrace change as a way to propel my career forward. I will discuss how being re-orged went from uncertainty to accelerating my career. I will discuss how being laid off was a blessing in disguise and led to a fulfilling new opportunity. Lastly, I will explore the challenges that come with starting a new role.

Through my personal stories and practical advice, I hope to inspire others to embrace change as an opportunity for growth in their own careers. Change can be scary, but it can also be a chance to learn, grow, and advance towards new and exciting opportunities.
