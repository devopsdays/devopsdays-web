If you’re working with just a few containers, managing them is not too complicated. But what if you have hundreds or thousands of containers? Think about having to handle multiple upgrades for each container, keeping track of container and node state, available resources, and more. That’s where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes is an open source container management platform that helps you run containers at scale. This talk will cover Kubernetes components and show how to run applications on it via a demo.
