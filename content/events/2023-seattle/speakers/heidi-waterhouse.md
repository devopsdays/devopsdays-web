Mercenary Marketing Maven

Heidi is an advocate for progressive delivery, organizational transformation, technical communication and marketing you hate slightly less. She is a nerd about industrial psychology and patterns of progress. One of her favorite hobbies is talking to developers about things they already knew but had never thought of that way before. She sews all her conference dresses so that she's sure there is a pocket for the mic.
