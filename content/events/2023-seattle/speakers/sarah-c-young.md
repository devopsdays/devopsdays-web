Senior Site Reliability Engineer

Seattle transplant most recently from London, I'm a former UK Civil Servant currently on a career break.

A decade ago I was a cultural historian of gender and computer science, turning to software development in 2014 and site reliability engineering in 2017. My professional dream is to become a Chief Joy Officer.

I think extreme programming is the catâ€™s pajama's, site reliability engineering is my happy place, and teamwork is the most exciting part of any job.
