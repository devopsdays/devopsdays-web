Developer Advocate, DevZero

Hi, I'm a 👨🏽‍💻 Software Developer turned Developer Advocate 🥑 with a passion for building and supporting tech communities. I'm all about using technology to empower people and make the world a better place. As a former software engineer, I understand that technology can be overwhelming and intimidating, which is why I'm passionate about making it more accessible and user-friendly. I graduated with a Master's degree in CS from the University of Houston. I am from the southern part of India and currently live in Houston. I spend countless hours organizing things so they look the way he wants and also spend the same in cooking to get the best out of my recipe.
