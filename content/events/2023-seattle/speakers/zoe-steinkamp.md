Developer Advocate InfluxDB

My name is Zoe Steinkamp and I am a developer Advocate for influxData, after working as a front end software engineer for over eight years. In my role as a Developer Advocate, I help developers to engage with InfluxData, including our database platform, open source tools, and Time-Series Data solutions. I have a passion for making developers' lives as well as learning about data science. My interests besides new technology include traveling and gardening. You can find me speaking at virtual and in person events and always feel free to reach out on linkedin.
