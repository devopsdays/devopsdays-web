<h2>TL;DR - DevOpsDays Seattle 2023 is CANCELLED. </h2>

It is with great sadness that we share the organizing teamâ€™s decision to cancel DevOpsDays Seattle 2023.

While we had a wonderful lineup of speakers coming from a strong Call For Papers and several great sponsors, attendee registration was simply too low. The team believes this is likely due to a combination of factors including the current macroeconomic environment, particularly in the technology sector, and slow progress on returning to community events following the COVID-19 pandemic.

<strong>All tickets will be refunded.</strong> You should expect to see an email confirmation of your refund within the next week.

<strong>We appreciate your interest in, and support of, our event-</strong> and hope to see you at DevOpsDays Seattle 2024. Follow us on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@seattle@devopsdays.org">mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/devopsdays-seattle/">linkedin</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/DevOpsDaysSEA">twitter</a> to get notified the next time we hold an event.
