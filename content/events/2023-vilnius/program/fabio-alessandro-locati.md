We will explore the shift from on-premise to the public cloud. The reasons behind it, advantages, and disadvantages. We will discuss what learnings and design choices we can bring back to private clouds. Uncover how to stricture modern private cloud, and discover which technologies can help you.

There has been a significant shift from on-premise data centers to the cloud in the last fifteen years. This process was due to the perceived cost difference between the legacy on-premise data centers and the newer and shinier cloud. Due to a renewed interest in privacy and data sovereignty, many organizations are returning to the on-premise. For the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a modern on-premise data center would be structured.
