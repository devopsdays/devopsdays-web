Do you want to know how Terraform scales with your organisation? You will learn about usual stages of Terraform adoption in a growing environment and learn how to avoid some of the pitfalls of those stages.
I have worked a lot as a consultant and have touched a lot of cloud infrastructures. I’ve been building Terraform-driven infrastructure from scratch for teeny-tiny startups, I’ve been working with Terraform codebase of enterprises, I’ve seen it all. I know how Terraform usage looks like when a company just has started its journey with it and I know what it becomes when it’s used in a big experienced company. So in this talk I will tell you about typical evolution of Terraform code and you might even recognise on which stage you are now. That will hopefully help you to avoid some of the pitfalls awaiting for you around the corner and build a better solution.
