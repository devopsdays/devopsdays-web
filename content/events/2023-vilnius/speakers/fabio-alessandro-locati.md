Associate Principal Solutions Architect at Red Hat

Fabio Alessandro Locati - commonly known as Fale - is Associate Principal Solutions Architect at Red Hat, public speaker, published author, and Open Source contributor. His main areas of expertise are Linux, containers (e.g., Kubernetes), automation (e.g., Ansible), security, cloud (mainly AWS and GCP), cloud technologies, databases, and networking.
With over 15 years of working experience in the field, he has experienced multiple IT roles, technologies, and languages. Fale has consulted for many diverse companies, starting from a one-person company to Fortune 500 companies. These experiences have allowed him to consider various technologies from multiple points of view, helping him develop critical thinking and understand quickly whether a particular technology is the right one for a specific project.
Since he is always looking for better technologies, he also tries new technologies to see their advantages and maturity status over the old ones. Fale evaluates every technology on its security, ethical and functional consequences, and many more.
Over the years, he has given more than 30 talks about his work, the projects he helps in his spare time, IT ethics, and his vision of the IT and security worlds.
He is the author of Practical Ansible 2, Learning Ansible 2, Learning Ansible 2.7, and OpenStack Cloud Security. He helps in the Kubernetes, Fedora Project, Ansible, Wikimedia, OpenStreetMap communities, and many smaller projects on GitHub and similar platforms in his spare time.
