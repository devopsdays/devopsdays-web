        <H3>FAQ</H3>
        <p><b>Q: What do I need to know about dedicated booth?</b> </p>
        <p><b>A:</b> We’ll provide you with tables and chairs, an electrical power socket as well as WIFI. Do not change
            or expand your booth without the written agreement of the organizers.</p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Q: Can I get a list of attendees? </b></p>
        <p><b>A:</b> No. It’s not allowed and no Devopsdays event does it. On the other hand, you can represent your
            company by proposing OpenSpace topics. Any Sponsor is free to collect attendee information with mutual
            consensus at their booth. </p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Q: Can I get a speaker spot if my company sponsors event?</b> </p>
        <p><b>A:</b> No. It’s not allowed and no Devopsdays event does it. But you can take part in Call for Proposal
            process as everyone else, but we can’t give you any advantage in selecting process.</p>
