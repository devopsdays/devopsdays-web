The health and safety of everyone who attends DevOpsDays DC 2022 is the first priority for us. We are taking responsible actions to protect the well-being of our attendees, speakers, volunteers, and organizers. We also want to provide a safe and engaging conference experience for as many attendees as possible.

As such, we are taking a number of precautions related to COVID-19.

We are following the [COVID-19 policies in place for the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center (RRBITC)](https://rrbitc.com/wp-content/uploads/Safer-and-Secure-Hybrid-Deck-R2.pdf), as required in our event agreement with the venue. These policies address guest and staff health, building safety, event space readiness, event flow, attendee experience and client responsibilities, and food and beverage. Currently the RRBITC is not requiring vaccinations or masks within the building, although those requirements may change between now and our event.

We are also taking steps beyond the RRBITC’s COVID-19 policies:

1. We are encouraging DevOpsDays DC 2022 attendees to use masks. We encourage each attendee to bring their own mask, but we will provide an N95 mask to each attendee who does not have one and wants to use one.

2. We will have hand sanitizer available to attendees, both from stations within the venue and from the conference.

3. We are limiting attendance for the conference so we have enough space within the venue to allow for roomier seating during the talks and open spaces.

As we have learned over the past two years, things are constantly changing when it comes to COVID-19. The organizers will continue to monitor federal, local, and venue policies closely and adjust our policies accordingly to ensure all who attend feel safe during our event. We reserve the right to delay the event, cancel the event completely, or change to a virtual event, if the in-person event cannot be held safely.

## Refund Policy

We’re living in a time of uncertainty, and making plans can be challenging. If you cannot attend DevOpsDays DC 2022 for any reason, you are welcome to transfer your ticket to another individual.

**If you’re sick, don’t attend.** If you need to cancel due to COVID-19 up to and including the day of the event, let us know and we will refund the full cost of your ticket.

If the RRBITC changes its COVID-19 policies such that you are unwilling or unable to comply and would prefer a refund instead of transferring your ticket to another individual, please contact us within seven (7) days of the change and we will refund the full cost of your ticket.

For changes to your registration, please email washington-dc@devopsdays.org.
