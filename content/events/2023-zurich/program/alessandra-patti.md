### Workshop

In this interactive session co-led by the founders of companies FindYourWay Coaching and Betreat, we are going to walk the audience through the concept of digital wellbeing.

Because mental wellbeing is such an important part of our holistic health, we shall not forget about our relationship with the digital. And, what better audience than technology and digital experts to relate to this topic. We will see what the digital experience of social media or always being "available" on different channels can trigger in us, for our self-esteem and our ability to cope with stress. We will see how the digital can help and at the same time overwhelm us, and how to navigate this so that we are in control and conscious of our "digital consumption". Even an email written without compassion can take a toll on our mental health and create immense stress on everyday workplace.

Business have more and more attention to the topic of mental health, and as we are companies committed to education, burnout prevention and wellness, we want to make greater awareness on this important aspect of wellbeing, and at the same time having companies engage with our joint programs that could benefit their teams and employees.
