### Ignite

Communities are the backbone of human experience and we evolved specifically to get rewarded from collaborative behaviour and the sharing of common values identified as our uniquely human culture. As Aristotle once wrote: “Man is by nature a social animal […] Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god.”
We will explore the neuroscience of community engagement, how it reflects in our open source software development patterns, how we can enhance and foster our innate tendency to pursue communal work, the biochemistry of community and how this can lead to better life satisfaction and increase productivity.
