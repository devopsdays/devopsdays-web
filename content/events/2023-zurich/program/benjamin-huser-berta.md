### Ignite

During this Ignite talk we will show how we attempted our transformation of culture, technology and ways of working in the OT product development area at Hitachi Energy Grid Automation. We show how we used automation to solve the security challenges and what non-technical factors were crucial in the process.

We devised solutions for fundamental challenges from a security perspective. For instance lack of visibility, compliance issues, process bottlenecks.
