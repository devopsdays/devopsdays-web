### Ignite

At first glance, the IT industry seems to be a relatively clean sector. However, the development and operation of software have a significant environmental impact that is often overlooked.
In this talk, we will see measures to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions along the software lifecycle, ranging from coding over datacenter operation to the way individuals are working. By the end of the presentation, attendees will have actionable suggestions to start reducing the environmental impact of their software.
