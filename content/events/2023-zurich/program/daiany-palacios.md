### Ignite

About a year ago I was faced with the task of building a team from scratch, to rebuild and redesign an old application into a new one, more modern and flexible to include a lot of new requirements. Counting with enough budget I started by proposing a usual setup: a system analyst (requirements engineer), a few full-stack, a tester and a DevOps engineer. However, the budget available at the end was allowing me to hire only 3 new employees. I went for the following setup: one system analyst and two full-stack DevOps engineers.
“Full-stack DevOps engineer”, is that even possible?
Well, I guess my colleagues would probably disagree to be called like that, though at the end that pretty much covers what they are effectively doing in the team now.
In this ignite talk I want to share some thoughts to further sparkle an opinion exchange with the audience about the scope of these two roles “Full-stack vs. DevOps”. Based on my experience, I will put the focus on the actual minimum skillset necessary to develop and maintain a system when the “usual” role-specific constellation in a team is simply not possible. What to search for in possible candidates? What to keep in mind and how a team dynamic could look like, in order to succeed.
