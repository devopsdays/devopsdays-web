### Talk

There is always more work than time. We’re getting requests from leadership, co-workers, customers, all the while dealing with bugs, tech debt, and things we actually want to do.
Sometimes everything seems urgent and has to be done yesterday, yet it’s impossible to do it all.
In this talk, I’ll share how to recognize what work is worth doing, when to say no, and how to avoid getting stuck in a firefighting loop.
