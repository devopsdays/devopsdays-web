### Workshop

Test-Driven Development is not an easy-to-master technique. You've to be very determined and self-disciplined to best exploit its advantages. As always, practice plays an important role. During the journey of learning the TDD, everyone has to deal with some failure at a certain time. Usually, this moment is when you're about to write a complex solution that is divided up into multiple layers that talk to each other. This is because most of the blog posts or tutorials out there don't provide and guide us through a more complex application but they rely on very trivial applications that anyone with a little experience can manage. In this workshop, I'll guide you in building a REST API to manage the TODOs. In the end, we'll have an application that allows us to manage TODOs stored in a PostgreSQL database.

To follow this workshop you must have a machine with the following prerequisites:

- Go 1.20 or above
- VSCode (or any other IDE you're comfortable with)
- Docker
- API Client (cURL, Postman, and so on)
- PostgreSQL client (DBeaver is the favorite)

The ideal listener should have the following prerequisites:

- Be familiar with HTTP concepts and REST-APIs (I won't cover the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol nor the REST standard)
- Have some prior experience with tests (even if it's poor)
- Have some experience in programming with Go (we won't cover the basics of the language)
- Be familiar with Docker (knowledge of the basic commands and concepts such as images and containers)
- Some expertise in databases

By completing this workshop the learner gains a hands-on experience with the TDD. Furthermore, he'll be ready to use it in his next project.
