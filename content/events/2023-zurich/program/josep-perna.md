### Ignite

I'm excited to share how we reduced our deployment cycle on Kubernetes from 2 months to just 1 day at Neural Concept. We will discuss how we restructured our CI, as well as how we removed circular dependencies form our codebase. Not only did this make our development process more efficient, but it also helped us stay ahead of the competition and created a dynamic work environment for our team. Join me as I take you through the steps we took and the impact it had on our developer culture.
