### Keynote

It's 2022, and as IDC predicted in October of 2020, 65% of the global GDP has been digitally transformed. Two-thirds of the products and services that you pay for are driven by software, and the quality, cost and time to market of your software products determine the fate of your business. There has never been a more important time to foster developer productivity, but many of our methods have not evolved.

In this keynote style talk you will learn why DPE is the most important development in the software engineering world since the introduction of Agile and DevOps concepts and tools. DPE is a new software development practice that uses acceleration technologies to speed up the software build and test process and data analytics to improve developer efficiencies by as much as 10x. The ultimate aim is to achieve faster feedback cycles, more reliable and actionable data, and a highly satisfying developer experience.

Justin Reock, Field CTO and Chief Evangelist at Gradle is pioneering DPE as a practice and set of technologies and is one of the world’s leading advocates. Specifically, Justin will provide an overview of the key concepts and tools, business impact on key business objectives like time-to-market, cost and quality, the business case for DPE, and the role of AI/ML in DPE moving forward.
