### Keynote

What’s the secret behind high-performing teams? It’s psychological safety, according to a famous Google study called Project Aristotle.

Teams with greater psychological safety, a.k.a. teams that have a shared expectation that teammates will not embarrass, reject, or punish each other for sharing ideas, taking risks, or soliciting feedback, not only tend to perform better, but also engage in behaviors that contribute to greater success and innovation.

That all sounds fancy, but how do you increase psychological safety in your team, especially during remote and hybrid work, with new or diverse personalities, or legacy tensions?

Learn from experts and real-life examples on how to foster psychological safety in your team in this hands-on session led by psychological safety expert and former Googler Laurence Kozera and engineer-turned-leadership coach Arjanna van der Plas.
