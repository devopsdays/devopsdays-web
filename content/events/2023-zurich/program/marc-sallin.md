### Talk

Our software ensures that all the parcels you order online find their way to your home. For every parcel that travels through the parcel centers of the Swiss Post, our services provide the next action to be taken. If these services are not running, the parcel truck soon begins to block the roads because they cannot unload anymore.Â 

Even with these stakes, we deploy our mission-critical software services multiple times a day. Every commit to the master branch goes straight into production. Magic? Not at all! In this talk, we will show you how we do this and discuss our journey with a focus on quality assurance.
