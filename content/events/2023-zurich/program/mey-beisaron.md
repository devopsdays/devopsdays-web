### Talk

“Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.” —Yoda, The Empire Strikes Back
Yoda is right. Becoming a Devops Engineer, after more than 5 years as a Backend Developer, has changed my professional life forever.

The need to learn and understand the complex CI/CD pipeline, architecture of multiple systems across the engineering department,
tackling build VS. buy decisions on a regular basis, develop and take ownership over critical systems - All of these together complete the DevOps puzzle.

In this talk, we will go through the steps of assembling this puzzle as a whole, and explain how I was able to completely transform the way I solve engineering problems - From a narrow application perspective to a wide holistic system architecture approach. By the end of this talk you will know how you can do it too- whether you want to keep at it with your dev role, switch to a DevOps role, or make any other big career change.
