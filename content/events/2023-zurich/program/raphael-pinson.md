### Talk

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful and versatile technology that can be used to extend observability in Linux systems. In this talk, we will explore how eBPF can be used to bridge the gap between dev and ops by providing a deeper understanding of the kernel and OS internals as well as the applications running on top. We will discuss how eBPF can be used to extend observability downwards by enabling access to low-level system information and how it can be used to extend observability upwards by providing application-level tracing capabilities.
