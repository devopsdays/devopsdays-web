### Workshop

Regardless if you're an engineer, tech lead or manager who's looking to grow in your current role or want to get promoted - leadership skills are always highly sought after. In this session we'll go through some of the most important skills which I've learned (typically, the hard way) over the past 8 years as a technical lead and engineering manager.

What I'm aiming to give you is a clear path forward for yourself which you can use straight away and what you should aim for next.

We'll cover topics such as:

* What should you do first?
* Effective Mentorship
* Using Systems Thinking
* Find and eliminate bottlenecks
* Measuring team and individual performance
* Influencing teams and individuals
* Recruiting
* ... many more tips and tricks!

This workshop will be interactive and uses a Miro board. Please bring your laptop to get the most out of it!
