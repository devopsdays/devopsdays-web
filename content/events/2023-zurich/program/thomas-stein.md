### Talk

In the Session “Development process of Cloud native applications - a story of transformation” Thomas and Timon will present the cloud native journey of SAP Cloud ALM. SAP Cloud ALM is a SaaS solution with over 2000 customers, 250 developers and more then 60 microservices. You will learn what the right question are, that you have to ask yourself when you create a new cloud product, how important it is to have the right core beliefs to reach the Elite-Level of DORA and that nothing speeds up a cloud transformation more than a paved road of tools. The session is intended to stimulate reflection why the software development process should always be understood as a system and not as the sum of the individual tools and processes.
