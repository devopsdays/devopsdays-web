### DevOps Engineer @ Neural Concept

Hey there! I'm a devops engineer with a passion for all things tech. I started out at Morgan Stanley with some legacy technology, then honing my skills at FundApps where it was all about serverless, and currently pushing the boundaries at Neural Concept where we love k8s.

I studied computer science at Glasgow University and Iâ€™m currently in the process of getting a Masters in Science, Technology and Policy at ETHZ, I know, quite the change!

When I'm not working, I love to ski and geek out over everything transport related.
