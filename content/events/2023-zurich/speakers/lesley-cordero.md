### Staff Software Engineer @ The New York Times

Lesley Cordero is currently a Staff Software Engineer at The New York Times. She has spent the majority of her career on edtech teams as an engineer, including Google for Education and other edtech startups.

In my previous roles I have focused on building robust data pipelines, setting technical strategy, building excellent engineering teams & communities, and reliability management. Some more specifics include setting org-wide vision & strategy for observability, improving on-call processes, adopting chaos engineering practices, and cultivating culture that builds with the most vulnerable employees in mind first.

I show care for others by holding them accountable to the best versions of themselves â€“ and by buying them the occasional bubble tea.
