# What is Conference Buddy?

Are you a seasoned conference-goer eager to share your expertise and expand your network? Or perhaps you're a first-time attendee feeling a bit overwhelmed by the bustling atmosphere? No matter where you fall on the spectrum, Conference Buddy is here to enhance your DevOpsDays experience.

As a veteran conference attendee, joining our program allows you to lend a guiding hand to newcomers, sharing your insights and helping them navigate the conference with ease. By offering your expertise and forging new connections, you not only enrich the experience of others but also deepen your own engagement with the DevOps community.

For those stepping into DevOpsDays for the first time, becoming a part of Conference Buddy opens doors to a wealth of opportunities. It makes it easy to connect with fellow attendees, find like-minded individuals, and engage in meaningful conversations right from the start.

But Conference Buddy isn't just about networking—it's about creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered. Through our program, we aim to foster a sense of community, break down barriers, and ensure that every participant feels seen and heard.

Join us at DevOpsDays and be a part of something bigger. Whether you're a veteran looking to pay it forward or a newcomer seeking guidance, Conference Buddy is your ultimate companion for a memorable and rewarding conference experience. Together, let's connect, collaborate, and make DevOpsDays 2024 truly unforgettable.

## What matters most

We want to help people to feel more included and welcome in our community. We all have to feel safe to do so! 

This event provides a Code of Conduct. While following this code is important anyway, you as Conference Buddy should be extra aware of it. If you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe, don't hesitate to reach out to someone from the [Code of Conduct team](https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-amsterdam/conduct).

We are here to support you!

## How does it work?

* Grab one of our badges. Wear it visibly on your lanyard or clothes! This lets others know that you are approachable and supportive.
* Approach people with Conference Buddy badges. (If you are comfortable with it!) Maybe you are the person to make them feel welcome. Or vice versa!
* Post on social media. Let others know that you are looking for a `#ConfBuddy`. Use the hashtag of the conference (`#devopsdays`) or tag it, too.
* Follow the Pacman rule. When standing as a group of people, always leave room for others to join your group. This sends a visual signal of: “Hey, you are welcome here!”. 
* Come to the Conference Buddy booth and hang out with us!
