Title = "Cloud-native warehouse automation: how Picnic pushes the boundaries of the cloud"
Type = "talk"

In 2022 Picnic opened its first fully automated warehouse. Groceries whiz by at a dazzling speed on conveyor belts, robot shuttles, and other automation components. Initially Picnic's own warehouse control system ran on-premise, since low-latency responses and stability are key to running a stable operation.

But as a cloud-native company, we set ourselves a challenge. Can we engineer a cloud-based system with the same guarantees? Turns out, we can! In this keynote we will share our lessons and the obstacles we had to overcome to make this reality. Engineering a cloud environment for low-latency automation control is one thing, migrating an on-premise setup to AWS while not disrupting a massive operational warehouse is quite another feat! Join this keynote to learn not just about the technology, but also about the people and processes it takes to pull this off.
