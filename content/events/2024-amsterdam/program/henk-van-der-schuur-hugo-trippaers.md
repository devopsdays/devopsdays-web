DevOps has become the de facto standard for teamwork in IT. Yet, it mainly concerns IT, and many teams keep struggling to bridge the gap with Business.

As a next step in our journey to involve Business better in DevOps dynamics, we share our near-3-year adventure with the Dutch railways (NS).

We show how we reshaped our engagement, cracked our commercial model, and improved the customer relationship along the way. We have found our approach puts engineering effects at the heart of business, proves to be a booster for team morale, and allows for more candid customer conversations.

In addition to the successes, we share our pitfalls and the lessons we learned along the way, and hope to inspire you to try our approach yourself!
