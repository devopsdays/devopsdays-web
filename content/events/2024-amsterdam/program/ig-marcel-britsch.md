Join me in this dark but also inspirational exploration of existential risks and what they mean for us working in technology.
Come explore how, for the first time, humanity — armed with unprecedented capabilities to both create and avert existential risks — finds itself at a unique turning point that may decide on the future - or not - of humanity and in fact all life on earth.
Understand the implications of the Fermi Paradox - or ‘why no one is out there’ - and the relevance of the ‘Great Filter’. We'll explore the specific threats posed by run-away greenhouse effect, nuclear destruction, alien invasion or super-intelligent AI. And the potential extinction of not only humanity, but all life.
As contributors to the tech landscape, we all play a crucial role, and collectively must become the architects of a future marked by resilience and ethical foresight, and guide humanity towards a secure tomorrow, transcending the challenges of the Great Filter.
