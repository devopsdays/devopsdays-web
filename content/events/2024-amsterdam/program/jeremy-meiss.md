Developer Experience (DevEx) is not just describing the "frontend" experience - it's about every aspect of the experience your developers (internal and external) have with your product, tooling, systems, etc. Platform engineering has emerged as this general way to remove developer toil, but DevEx is more than that, encompassing everything from deployment pipelines to IaC practices to developer efficiencies to even UI/UX. In this talk we will seek to bring into focus some of the principles of DevOps (collaboration, communication, shared responsibility) and how a strong DevEx mindset can bring Dev and Ops together.
