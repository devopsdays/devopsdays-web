Join us in this talk, open to anyone vested in the tech industry's future, as we embark on an exploration into the ideal of meritocracy.
Do the industry's efforts in championing meritocracy match up to its noble intentions?
Through a comprehensive analysis of data, research, and anecdotes, we examine our collective efforts in rewarding talent and hard work in the pursuit of fairness.
This presentation examines the impact of our well-intentioned efforts in areas such as performance evaluations, hiring, promotion, skill development, and funding, inviting the audience to reevaluate their role in shaping a fair and just industry.
