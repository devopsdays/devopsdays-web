Science has brought mankind lots of knowledge on how things around us work. It provided us with laws and formulas that help us to predict the behavior of materials and systems.

Physicists like Carnot, Clausius, Planck and Kelvin explored the field of thermodynamics and laid the foundation for what we now know as the second law of thermodynamics, which introduced the concept of entropy. Okay, but what the heck does this have to do with DevOps and IT?

Well, in an ever expanding and evolving IT-landscape, entropy and thus the second law of thermodynamics, come into play. Are we doomed by this law or can we somehow turn the tide?

This talk will be a tiny little bit of a physics lessons, but after some torturous formulas and a live experiment/demonstration, all will be nicely translated to our daily work as IT pros.
