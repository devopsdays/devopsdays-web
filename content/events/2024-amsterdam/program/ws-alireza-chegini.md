In the era of rapid digital transformation, the challenge for many organisations extends beyond cloud migration to the realms of efficiency and cost optimisation in cloud infrastructure. This workshop, led by an experienced Azure Architect, focuses on proactive strategies for managing and reducing Azure cloud costs without impacting performance or project delivery timelines.

Key Objectives:
* Understanding Cloud Cost Dynamics: Unveil the common pitfalls in cloud cost management post-migration, emphasising the importance of a proactive approach in early project stages.
* Cost Analysis and Reduction Techniques: Demonstrate practical methods to analyse current Azure expenditures, identifying and mitigating areas of unnecessary spending.
* Efficient Design and Implementation: Share best practices for designing and implementing new features and infrastructure cost-effectively from the outset.
* Balancing Cost, Performance, and Timeliness: Discuss strategies to manage the triad of cloud computing – cost, performance, and project delivery – ensuring an optimal balance.
Workshop Structure:
    * Introduction to Cloud Cost Management Challenges
    Overview of common challenges in post-migration cloud cost management.
    Case studies highlighting the impact of reactive cost management approaches.
