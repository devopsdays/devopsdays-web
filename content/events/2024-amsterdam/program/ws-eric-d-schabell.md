Speakers = ["eric-d-schabell"]
+++
Ready to break free from vendor lock-in and predatory pricing from your SaaS observability vendor? It’s time to learn more about Prometheus, a free and open-source systems monitoring and alerting tool kit that enables you to discover, collect, and query your observability data. Join us for this workshop designed to expand your knowledge of open-source observability tools, including how they are used and how they are different from the proprietary instrumentation you use today. This hands-on workshop is designed to help central observability team leaders, engineering managers, and site reliability engineers (SREs) get enough background to start moving their teams away from proprietary instrumentation and get them started with open-source observability. During the workshop, you will install Prometheus, collect metrics, and learn how to effectively run it in your observability stack. Get started today and so your team can hit the ground running with open-source observability!
