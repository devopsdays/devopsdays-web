Have you ever wanted to be on stage, but feel uncomfortable in front of many people? Or are you already a speaker and would like to improve your stage presence? Then this is the workshop for you!

Folks often underestimate how the way you carry yourself can make all the difference between an engaging talk and a total snoozefest. And this isn’t only relevant to public speaking. But any face to face interactions like meetings or social gatherings can benefit from a bit of “stage presence”.

In this workshop, we will learn how to be truly present and connect with our bodies, packed with exercises and games, commonly used in theatre productions. So at your next presentation, you can use these techniques to draw in your audience.
