Technology drives value and innovation in every organization. At Google Cloud, we have learned a lot about what it takes to build and scale high-performing technology teams. Our own lived experience combined with a multi-year research program by the DORA team can be used to help you and your team transform into a high-performing technology team.

This workshop will help you put the insights of the research framework into practice. Participants will:

1. Describe your team's current software delivery process
2. Set baseline performance metrics
3. Compare your performance with your peers in the industry
4. Use DORA's predictive analysis to identify where to make your next improvement
5. Set some goals

By the end of this workshop you will have one improvement story to add to your backlog as you take the next step toward becoming an elite performing team. And, you'll be able to repeat the process with your own team in your quest to get better at getting better!
