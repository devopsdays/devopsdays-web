Hey there! I am a tech enthusiast, retro gamer, and general nerd. When I am not busy breaking stuff for fun, I can be found breaking stuff professionally at Capgemini. You also might find me restoring and modifying old video game systems, most notably Game Boys.

I believe in simple explanations and demos over slide-heavy presentations. Join my talks if you want to have a good time, get some free stickers, and maybe learn something new!

I put down whatever catches my attention on my blog, https://damn.engineer, and my Twitter account, @theEugeneRomero.
