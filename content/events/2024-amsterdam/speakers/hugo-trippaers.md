The power of open source communities lies in the willingness to share knowledge: when people with different backgrounds work together, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

As a mission critical engineer I have been working for Schuberg Philis for the past seventeen years. In this role I get to combine the two specialisations that have been my passion for the past two decades: software engineering and system engineering.

I'm involved in various open source communities and I've been giving presentations at both community events and company events for some time now. It is my conviction that sharing knowledge is the driving factor behind successful projects.

I find it inspiring to come together with a group of likeminded people to find solutions to complex problems. I strive to bridge the gaps between software engineering and system engineering and to create circumstances in which both fields complement and strengthen each other.
