JJ works as a Developer Advocate representing IBM worldwide. He engages in the IBM’s watsonx service, the Open Source AI ecosystem, and Kubernetes ecosystem with a focus on Red Hat’s OpenShift. He attempts to teach enterprises and users succesful skills to onboard to the AI and Cloud Native ecosystem though he learned his trade in the DevOps ecosystem. If he isn’t building high level automation to streamline his work, he’s building the groundwork to prepare for that need. He’s been an avid homelaber and self-hoster of open source software for years and gives back to that community as much as possible.
