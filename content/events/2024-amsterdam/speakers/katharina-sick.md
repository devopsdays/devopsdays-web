I'm all about making things user-friendly, especially when it comes to Cloud Native and Kubernetes.

I've done a fair share of mobile app and backend work, but lately, I'm really into Cloud Native computing and enjoy it a lot.

Outside of work, you'll find me hanging out in tech and sports communities, cruising on inline skates, exploring new places, or challenging myself with quizzes and games.
