Marcel Britsch

Digital consultant, product manager and facilitator

Marcel Britsch is an independent Digital Consultant, Product Manager and Agile Transformation specialist.
He has been living and working in London for over 20 years. He has worked with creatively and technically focused agencies, consultancies and clients across retail, education, conservation, automotive, finance, healthcare and energy.
He helps organisations build solid products and services in a sustainable way by facilitation, pairing, coaching or hands-on product management.
He believes that project success is strongly linked to happy teams, value-focused decision-making and fast feedback cycles. He is passionate about finding the best tools and techniques to optimise team culture, ways of working and solution design. He considers projects that follow classic waterfall / big-design-up-front practices to be too likely doomed to go anywhere near them, but loves to help organisations build products and transform in incremental evolutionary fashion or move towards this approach.
Outside of work he is interested in SciFi and comic books, Theravada Buddhist meditation and number theory.
He is a regular speaker at conferences, teaches at Cambridge University, blogs at www.thedigitalbusinessanalyst.com, hosts the https://www.theburnup.com podcast about ‘all things agile’, and can be found at https://www.beautifulabstraction.com.
