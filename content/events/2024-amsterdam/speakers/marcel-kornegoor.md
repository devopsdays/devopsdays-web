Marcel Kornegoor obtained his Master of Arts degree in Sound and Music Technology back in 2008. He has been a (huge) nerd for most of his life, but will probably deny it when confronted. Nowadays, he works as director of training at the Dutch open source and Linux specialist AT Computing. Being a technology-addict for around 20 years, Marcel provides training courses, talks and writes about cloud technology, DevOps, and other IT and open source related subjects that concern him. Most recently, he started to explore the world of yak shaving.
