I love solving challenges by designing and building solutions that create real value.
Sometimes I wonder, why engineering is disconnected from business needs, and then I try to build up the bridges again. I do so as an architect, lead developer or trainer, and I use Domain Driven Design and collaborative modelling as my instruments.
