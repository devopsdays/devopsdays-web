Wouter Lagerweij is an independent coach who covers the whole spectrum: from the technical practices of Dev and Ops, through process and organization all the way to business and product. He’s also the author of the upcoming book: “A Product Owner’s Guide To Escaping Legacy: How to get back in control and start delivering again”

He loves spending time with teams and organizations, from small startups to large enterprises, to figure out how to improve the way they make software, and make it more fun. To make that happen Wouter uses the knowledge and skills gathered in over twenty years of experience applying Agile processes and practices from XP, Scrum, Kanban, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Lean and Systems Thinking. 

To turn those improvements into real business opportunities, Wouter has added Lean Startup/Lean Enterprise approaches. He's even been known to, occasionally, use common sense.
