## devopsdays Amsterdam

- **When and where is the event?**
    
    devopsdays Amsterdam will be held on June 19-21, at Pakhuis de Zwijger in Amsterdam.
    
- **What are the payment options?**
    
    We can accept payments via bank transfer (preferred) or credit card (fees are to be paid by you). All sponsors must make payments within 30 days to avoid the cancellation of the contract. Sponsorship is not confirmed until payment is received, and as such, no sponsor benefits will be available until complete payment (logo on website, ticket redemption codes, etc.
    
- **When do I need to pay?**
    
    If the event is more than 30 days away, the payment terms are NET30, from the date mentioned on the
    invoice. If the event is less than 30 days away, the payment terms are NET15, from the date mentioned on
    the invoice.If the event is less than 15 days away, the payment terms are immediate.
    
- **Can I reserve a sponsor slot?**
    
    We cannot hold sponsorship slots, they are sold on a first come first served basis. You reserve your slot by signing the sponsorship agreement.
    
- **What are the behavior expectations of sponsors?**
    
    Sponsors are expected to follow our event’s Code of Conduct (https://devopsdays.org/amsterdam/conduct). 
    
    Advertising and booths should be non-sexualized. Do not perform activities disruptive to the event or large/noisy events that disrupt conference talks or activities.
    
- **How big is our booth space?**
    
    There are 2 types of booths available, gold and silver. Platinum and beer sponsors get space allocated in the
    gold sponsor area. 
    **Gold sponsors** get a 180 x 90 cm table.
    **Silver sponsors** get a 45cm in diameter high standing table. 
    All booths come with a power strip and 2 chairs. Conference wifi is available to use. TV screen (55”) rental is available upon request for €300 plus VAT but will need 2 weeks notice before the event.
    
- **Can we bring in roll-up banners as our back wall?**
    
    Whatever you bring must fit behind or on your table. Keep in mind, this conference is not about the booth!
    
- **How are booths assigned?**
    
    Booths are assigned by the organizers based on the room layout of the venue. You will receive your booth number by email 2 weeks before the event.
    
- **Do we get any sponsored talks?**
    
    No, but you are welcome to submit a talk proposal for consideration. See [this link](https://talks.devopsdays.org/devopsdays-amsterdam-2024/cfp) for more information.
    
- **What does the one minute pitch consist of?**
    
    Certain sponsors are given a specific scheduled one minute spot on the main stage to introduce themselves
    and their company to the full audience. The emcee will invite a small number to make their announcement
    during transitions between sessions. The specific schedule will be communicated to you in advance.
    
- **Who should I send to the conference?**
    
    We have found that companies get a better response when they send technical staff that can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks. Sponsor personnel are free to attend the sessions and participate in the group conversations and Open Spaces
    process as part of the community. As a practitioner-focused event, this isn’t a place where doing pure marketing and just trying to gather leads is as effective as engaging with the attendees with demos and technically knowledgeable people
    
- **Do we get contact info of attendees?**
    
    No. As a community organized and attendee-driven conference we find that ensuring attendee privacy is important to get the quality of attendees and contributions we need. You are welcome to gather information via your sponsor table from those who wish to opt in to your company’s communications.
    
- **Do you work with badge scanners?**
    
    Our badges do not have barcodes on them. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring
    engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the event instead of scanning badges at the booth for later engagement. You are responsible to collect any information you want in person at your booth. The most effective option sponsors use is to do a raffle and have people submit business cards/write their info on a tablet or computer.
    
- **Can we do a giveaway on stage?**
    
    **Yes**; we perform raffle drawings and giveaways at the end both Day 1 and Day 2 as part of the closing ceremony. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g., business cards, entry slips) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use at your table or via other means. At the closing session we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.
    
- **Can I coordinate my own events inside/alongside devopsdays Amsterdam?**
    
    **Not without coordinating with us.** If you have a specific idea / request, please talk to us beforehand. ‘Surprise’ events that conflict with conference events will not be promoted and may result in revocation of sponsorship. We’re happy to work with sponsors who want to host book signings, or have events during lunch or after our happy hour, but please discuss it with us well ahead of time.
    
- **What are the demographics of the attendees?**
    
    Our attendees are generally towards the medium and senior-level of the spectrum, though we are proud to host a forward-thinking group of techies in more junior roles. In surveys, attendees identify as working as in operations and IT engineering, with a small percentage indicating management or C-level position.
    
- **Can you combine a deal for me with devopsdays Eindhoven?**
    
    Yes! Besides devopsdays Amsterdam there is a second devopsdays event in the Netherlands, namely devopsdays Eindhoven which takes place in the Fall. We offer a 15% discount to sponsors for where you sponsor both events in the same tier (ie: gold or silver sponsor for both events). **If you’d like to sponsor both events, but would like different tiers in each, please contact us and we’d be happy to work with you**.
    
    If you’d like to sponsor both events, we’d love to have you! **Please note that this discount is only redeemable
    before June 1st, 2023.**
    
- **Can you combine a deal for me with other DevOpsDays events?**
    
    No. All DevOpsDays events are run independently by local practitioners in that city. DevOpsDays is an umbrella brand we use to put on the events, but there is no fiscal relationship between individual events. Therefore, we don’t have any ability to combine sales with other events.
    
- **How do we register our sponsor tickets?**
    
    Once you have completed your payment, we will send you a unique code to register the number of tickets associated with your tier.
    
- **Can I buy extra tickets?**
    
    Yes. Once you have completed your payment, we will send you a unique code to register up to 10 additional
    tickets for your company at 25% off. Or if you’d prefer an invoice and buy tickets that way reach out to us at
    [amsterdam@devopsdays.org](mailto:amsterdam@devopsdays.org)
    
- **What about a swag bag for attendees or a swag table to put promo materials?**
    
    If you have a sponsorship tier that includes a booth, that is the perfect place to hand your promo materials. In addition there will be swag tables made available in the conference area. Feel free to make your promo materials available there. Whether or not you have a booth space.
    
- **What kind of swag should I put on the table?**
    
    The choice is yours to make, but we, the organizers from devopsdays, prefer sustainable goodies. If you need help, please don’t hesitate to ask us.
    
- **Is it possible to donate money to charity instead of bringing swag?**
    
    Yes, it’s possible to donate money to charity instead of putting goodies on the swag table. Some local charities could use some love, and we would love to advise and help you with that.
    
    We will also mention your exemplary deeds on stage during the event, so you don’t have to worry about exposure.
    
- **Can we ship stuff ahead?**
    
    Yes, you can. Please get in touch with us to make arrangements (email: [amsterdam@devopsdays.org](mailto:organizers-amsterdam-2018@devopsdays.org?subject=Sponsor%20FAQ%20question) ).
    
- **How do we get our stuff back?**
    
    It is the responsibility of each sponsor to remove everything that they brought to the conference. Please arrange to remove all the material you bring with you by the close of the event.
