Respect and empathy are core DevOps values. Sponsors are required to follow our event’s [Code of Conduct](https://devopsdays.org/amsterdam/conduct). Please familiarize yourself with this document and act accordingly.

We highly encourage using Amsterdam's public transportation system to get to and from the event. GVB Bus 43, Bus 246 and Bus N89 stop right in front of the location, as does Tram 26, departing from Amsterdam Centraal Station (main train station in the city).

### <a name= 'Shipping'></a> Shipping
You can ship your materials to our venue if needed. Please note however that materials cannot arrive before **June 13th** since our selected venue simply has not enough space to store items for a longer period. The organizers are **not** responsible if your materials show up before **June 13th**. Materials need to arrive at the venue no later than **June 18th**. Your setup day is June 19 (the workshop day of the event).

**Note:** If you need to ship materials ahead of time to the conference. Please contact the devopsdays sponsorteam at [amsterdam@devopdays.org](mailto:amsterdam@devopdays.org) to arrange this.


## <a name= 'General-Sponsor-Activities'></a> General Sponsor Activities

### <a name= 'Marketing-Materials'></a> Marketing Materials

***Please*** be incredibly mindful of any materials you plan on shipping or bringing to devopsdays Amsterdam (e.g., “corporate collateral”), that you would like to hand out to attendees or to include on the attendee swag table. The maximum attendance at the conference is 600 people, and not everyone will be looking to take a handout.

Every year we are forced to throw away printed material that sponsors have brought with them and do not take away with them, and often these materials are unable to be recycled.  We fully support maximum exposure for your company and brand, but with as minimal a footprint as possible. Please also see the cleanup guidelines below.

For the 2024 edition of devopsdays Amsterdam, we are making an extra effort to ensure that our conference is not only a huge success but an environmentally friendly one too.

### <a name= 'Swag-Table'></a> Swag table

This year, we will place all inserts on a swag table, meaning that no swag bag will be pre-filled. The swag table will be signed clearly, and every attendee will be made aware of its existence both at registration, on printed maps, and during the program by the MCs (Masters of Ceremonies).

### <a name= 'Cleanup-Guidelines'></a> Cleanup Guidelines

***Please*** ensure that for any material that you bring or have shipped to the conference, that you have made arrangements to remove all that is left at the end of the conference.  devopsdays Amsterdam cannot accept responsibility for the removal of your marketing material.

This guideline applies to **all** materials, not just brochures and handouts.

If you intend to distribute promotional items at your table, we strongly encourage only bringing enough for the size of your potential audience and ensure to arrange the removal of any leftovers at the end of the conference.

Please bear in mind, unfortunately, we are unable to provide a ‘return shipping’ option.

### <a name= 'Wifi'></a> WiFi

Full conference WiFi is available.  We do recommend running demos ‘locally’ - there will be a few hundred techies on-site, and they do tend to use a lot of bandwidth, so we cannot guarantee bandwidth for large demonstrations.

### <a name= 'Lead-Capture'></a> Lead Capture

As a reminder, there is **no** lead capture assistance available, and do not share attendee information with sponsors.  You are more than welcome to capture leads at your table.  Having a giveaway is a popular way to accomplish this goal ;-).

### <a name= 'Giveaways'></a> On-stage giveaways

**Yes**; we perform raffle drawings and giveaways at the end both Day 1 and Day 2 as part of the closing ceremony. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g., business cards, entry slips) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use at your table or via other means. At the closing session we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.

### <a name= 'Side-Events'></a> Side events

**Can I coordinate my own events inside/alongside devopsdays Amsterdam?**

**Not without coordinating with us.** If you have a specific idea / request, please talk to us beforehand. ‘Surprise’ events that conflict with conference events will not be promoted and may result in revocation of sponsorship. We’re happy to work with sponsors who want to host book signings, or have events during lunch or after our happy hour, but please discuss it with us well ahead of time.


## <a name= 'Specific-Sponsor-Activity'></a> Specific sponsor activities

### <a name= 'TableSpace'></a> Tablespace for Platinum, Beverage, Gold and Silver sponsors

If you are a Silver, Gold, Platinum or Beverage sponsor you are are assigned one of our table spaces. There will be a power strip provided between every two tables.  The venue assures us that there will be plenty, but please don’t hesitate to let us know if you think you will require more outlets.

Furthermore, a TV screen (55”) rental is available upon request for €300 plus VAT but will need 3 weeks notice (May 31st) before the event.

### <a name= 'PlatBeerGold'></a> Platinum, Beer and Gold sponsors

Gold sponsors have a table of their own at the event (unless otherwise discussed and arranged).  Gold tables are 180cm x 90cm with two chairs.  The table is covered with a black tablecloth, but you are free to replace it with your own.  If you intend to bring a pop-up banner or other branded material, it needs to remain behind your table - therefore, it should not be more extensive than your table.

***Please*** consider your table as your personal meeting place to talk and learn from other DevOps enthusiasts.  As a Gold sponsor, you get a lot of freedom: signage, giveaways, and perfectly deployed infrastructure with no manual changes - anything goes as long as it stays behind your table and doesn’t exceed 2 meters in height.

### <a name= 'Pitches'></a> One-Minute Pitch

As a Gold, Platinum, Coffee or Beer sponsor you show commitment to our community and probably want to share a few words with us.  To that end, you have one minute to reach out to the audience. This moment is the perfect bulletin to pitch a relevant product or let people know you are hiring.

Sponsor pitches are on both days.  We’ll let you know your time slot the day before the event on June 18.  It’s important that each sponsor be available for their time slot.

### <a name= 'Silver'></a> Silver sponsors

Silver sponsors get a smaller high table, approximately 45cm in diameter, with two chairs.  As a Silver sponsor, you also have options: bring some signage, hand out giveaways, you know how it works.  Get in touch with us if you have something else in mind.

For any sponsor, we encourage you to send your engineers to interact with our attendees during session breaks. Naturally, we will make sure all tables have enough power to get live demos of your latest showcases going.

### <a name= 'Platinum'></a> Platinum sponsorship extras

You are not only free to, but highly encouraged to display your branding with roll-up banners or beach flags during this period in the common area around the outside area. As a Platinum sponsor you are also invited to join us for the speaker dinner (2 tickets).

The DevHops beers will also be available after the program ends on Wednesday and Friday although no organized program is in-place during those days. 

At the end of the event the Beverage sponsor can take away 48 bottles (2 cases) of DevHops to taste with team members wo were not able to attend.

## <a name= 'FAQ'></a> Other FAQ
    
- **Who should I send to the conference?**
    
    We have found that companies get a better response when they send technical staff that can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks. Sponsor personnel are free to attend the sessions and participate in the group conversations and Open Spaces process as part of the community. As a practitioner-focused event, this isn’t a place where doing pure marketing and just trying to gather leads is as effective as engaging with the attendees with demos and technically knowledgeable people.
    
- **Do we get contact info of attendees?**
    
    No. As a community organized and attendee-driven conference we find that ensuring attendee privacy is important to get the quality of attendees and contributions we need. You are welcome to gather information via your sponsor table from those who wish to opt in to your company’s communications.
    
- **Do you work with badge scanners?**
    
    Our badges do not have barcodes on them. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring
    engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the event instead of scanning badges at the booth for later engagement. You are responsible to collect any information you want in person at your booth. The most effective option sponsors use is to do a raffle and have people submit business cards/write their info on a tablet or computer.
    
- **What are the demographics of the attendees?**
    
    Our attendees are generally towards the medium and senior-level of the spectrum, though we are proud to host a forward-thinking group of techies in more junior roles. In surveys, attendees identify as working as in operations and IT engineering, with a small percentage indicating management or C-level position.
    
- **How do we register our sponsor tickets?**
    
    Once you have completed your payment, we will send you a unique code to register the number of tickets associated with your tier.
    
- **Can I buy extra tickets?**
    
    Yes. Once you have completed your payment, we will send you a unique code to register up to 10 additional tickets for your company at 25% off. Or if you’d prefer an invoice and buy tickets that way reach out to us at [amsterdam@devopsdays.org](mailto:amsterdam@devopsdays.org)
