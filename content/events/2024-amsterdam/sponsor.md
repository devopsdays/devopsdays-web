<hr>
Devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that relies on sponsors. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors can have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
<br><br>
Gold sponsors get a full table, and Silver sponsors get a standing table to interact with those interested during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject during the open spaces. However, this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<br><br>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their terms
