In the era of (Gen)AI + Large Language Models (LLMs), organizations are rushing to adopt this transformative technology. However, the key to success lies not just in the models themselves, but in the data platforms that support them. In this talk, we'll explore how data platforms enable fast flow and manage cognitive load in LLM initiatives. Through the lens of Team Topologies, we'll uncover strategies for designing and managing these platforms to drive collaboration, efficiency, and innovation in the face of the LLM hype.
