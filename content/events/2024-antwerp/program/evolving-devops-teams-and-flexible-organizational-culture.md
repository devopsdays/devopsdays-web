Based on my practical experience, I will be talking about:
- What kind of culture keeps a team an ever-changing DevOps team?
- How can leadership enable a team to be a continuously changing DevOps team?


Medical care in Japan is still going through the journey of digitization, therefore it is still  inconvenient for both the recipients and providers of care. Kakehashi, a Japanese medical startup, is taking on the challenge of developing a variety of products to make the Japanese medical experience more flexible.


My team is dedicated  to launching new businesses. After about six months of PoC, we aim to work with an existing product for pharmacies and pharmacists, which has a high market share in Japan, and to spread the results of PoC to existing customers.
Our team's relationship with DevOps has transitioned over the past year throughout our ways of working.

MVP Phase: Prioritize shortening lead time to release. However, laid the foundation for trunk-based development with a future perspective.

PoC Phase: A high-speed hypothesis testing cycle was conducted with actual customers using the system. The DevOps element of the project became more clear.

Collaboration Phase: 
Develop while adopting a release flow that can withstand the quality expected by the enterprise. Develop while collaborating with team members in charge of existing products through pair programming and other means.
