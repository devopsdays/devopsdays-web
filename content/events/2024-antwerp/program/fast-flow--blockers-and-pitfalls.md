Based on his experience helping customers with Team Topologies during the last 5 years, Manuel will rant about... sorry, share what are the most common blockers to fast flow in tech organizations. From the classics originally illustrated in the Team Topologies book to the "new kids on the block", some of which come from misinterpretations of ideas in the book! This rant talk also contains personal reflections on what we would have done differently if we had to rewrite the book today.
