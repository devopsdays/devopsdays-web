DevOps spread has leveled out, it's no longer a fast growing mindset and set of accompanying tools. Some surveys show that 70% of people are still not automating their builds, let along production deployment. DevOps companies are facing growth challenges.

This talk is an analysis of slowing DevOps growth and what it means for you.
