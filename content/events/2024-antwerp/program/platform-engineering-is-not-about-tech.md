"What are we using for pipelines? Which infrastructure do we support? Is service mesh enabled?”. These types of questions - revolving on tech choices and implementation - currently occupy most of the conversations around platform engineering.

According to most evidence, though, these are not the only things that make a cloud-native platform successful: cultural change, communication and collaboration, reorganized processes, shared vision and roadmap - among others - play a key role in determining the success of platform transformation. If we don’t address change comprehensively, the risk is that in a few years we’ll discover that platforms are not bringing the results we expected.

In this talk we’ll see some key aspects that are often overlooked in implementing a platform and how it’s possible to address them along the way. We’ll also share some of the pitfalls and lessons we learned in our experience, supporting large and small organizations in building their cloud-native platforms.
