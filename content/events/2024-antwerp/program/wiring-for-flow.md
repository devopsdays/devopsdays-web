Wiring for Fast Flow
Based on a paper I co-wrote with Cisco's John Rauser, this talk introduces the key mechanisms and principles that enable the internet's extreme flow at scale and our best collaboration. This talk will introduce three critical missing pieces in almost every company's attempt to enable fast flow, and how those pieces can be easily missed in a performance improvement journey.
