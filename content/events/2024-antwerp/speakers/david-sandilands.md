David Sandilands is an author and I.T. infrastructure expert who focuses on the management of Puppet’s development ecosystem and integrations. Prior to this, he worked within Puppet’s customer services team where he helped Puppet’s largest customers deliver infrastructure automation at scale and contributed to their DevOps working practices. 

In 2023, David published “Puppet 8 for DevOps Engineers” which is available through major book outlets. That year, he also became a DevOps Advisory Board Member for DevNetwork. David’s expertise is called upon for the annual State of DevOps Report (SODOR), and he’s also a frequent contributor to Puppet’s “Pulling the Strings” podcast, a community event presenter, and a popular webinar guest. 

David has a passion for delivering change into traditional working environments, breaking down team silos, and integrating DevOps practices within heavily regulated and audited environments. Before joining Puppet by Perforce, David spent eight years at NatWest as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer delivering their Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Platform. 

Outside of work, David is an accomplished hillwalker (Munroist number: 3085) having climbed all 282 of the Scottish Monros. He also enjoys sci-fi and fantasy books and regularly visits Scotland's tractor parks with his wife and two sons.
