Steve has spent over two decades improving the flow of work across organizations. He's worked through tech support, IT management, build and release engineering, and as a founding CTO for enterprise SaaS.

He serves as lead consultant for Visible Flow Consulting, as a board advisor to the Value Stream Management Consortium, Chair of the OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability technical committee, and co-founder of the Flow Collective to bring flow-focused professionals together. Since 2017, he has been developing and facilitating Flow Engineering to make flow improvement in large organizations accessible. collaborative, and actionable.
