### How Do I Submit a Talk?

<a href="https://talks.devopsdays.org/devopsdays-austin-2024/cfp" class="btn btn-info">Submit a Proposal via Pretalx!</a>

### Theme

The theme for DevOpsDays Austin 2024 is **The Beat Goes On**. We wanted to bring forward the focus on resilence from our 2023 event as budget crunches and layoffs have continued to plague the industry. As such, we're centering on *improvising through the chaos with a music-focused theme*. We want to hear your stories of coming through a cycle of change, whether that's a well-executed plan or rising from a series of dumpster fires. Help us learn through your experiences. Preference will be shown to DevOps practitioners talking about their stories, their problems, and their approaches. The best kind of talk says “as an X, I had the problem Y, and here’s how I addressed it, and here’s the results both good and bad.”

### Formats

There are three talk formats this year:
* Ignite
* Presentation
* Workshop

Please reference the CFP directly for more information.

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request (come to office hours! Find out more in the CFP).
- _under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn't likely to have already seen.
- _no third-party submissions_: This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
