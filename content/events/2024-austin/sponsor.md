DevOpsDays Austin is now in its TWELFTH year and is consistently one of the best attended and reviewed DevOpsDays events on the planet. Sponsoring DevOpsDays Austin enables you to connect with leaders and newcomers alike in the vibrant Tech Hub that is the Austin community. Attendees are people who will be making or influencing decisions for years about security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and product development at leading companies in Central Texas and beyond.

DevOpsDays Austin 2024 will be held at the UT Austin Alumni Center from May 2-3, 2024, and will accommodate a cap of 400 attendees. Our theme this year will be "The Beat Goes On" that combines Austin's music culture with a mindset of pushing forward through changes with resilience.
