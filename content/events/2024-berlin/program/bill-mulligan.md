There are many open source mentorship like LFX, Google Season of Docs, and Outreachy to help people get started in their careers. However, we don't often talk about the benefits these programs can bring to the mentors, not just the mentees.

This talk draws on my experience being a mentor in these programs to discuss how they have helped build both your open source community and team at the company you work for. The audience will learn why they should get involved as a mentor and what they stand to gain from the program too.
