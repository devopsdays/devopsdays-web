Interested in mentoring and coaching junior developers & career changers? Then this talk is for you.

As a former tech recruiter turned into a Cloud Engineer, I have seen both sides: hiring and developing junior engineers as well as being one myself. Through real-world examples and personal anecdotes, I will share insights into potential pitfalls and success factors involved in working with juniors and career changers.
