I'm Azer Abdullaev, a site reliability engineer, currently working at REACTORCOREMELTDOWN, but representing myself and my own projects at DevOpsDays Berlin.

What drives me? 

* 🏗️ Building continuous integration pipelines (here goes Jenkins, Travis, Gitlab CI, Drone.io).
* 👀 Monitoring. It's a complicated but vital topic. First hand experience with Nagios & similar systems.
* 📈 Logging, monitoring, and data flow. Familiar with ELK and Grafana, able to make apps speak JSON, less familiar with Prometheus, but that's on my personal roadmap.
* 📦 Maintaining container runtime engines. Kubernetes, docker, podman, everything that makes life easier.
* 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code. Had worked with Puppet, Ansible, Terraform and Helm; personally prefer plain old Makefiles.

Besides code and work

Sometimes I make noise.
