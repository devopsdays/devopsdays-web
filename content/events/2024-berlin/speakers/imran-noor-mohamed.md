Imran Noor Mohamed is a product manager and open source contributor. My journey from software development to product management began with a keen interest in seeing the bigger picture of technology and its impact on end users. In my current role as Senior Technical Product Manager at Delivery Hero, I focus on improving the platform (foundations) and adopting a customer-first approach.

I am excited and committed to share my thoughts on fostering a culture of innovation (long term), with the right balance away from firefighting.
