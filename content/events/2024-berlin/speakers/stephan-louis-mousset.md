My name is Stephan and I am looking to attend DevOpsDays Berlin this year. I am working for ING as a Global Product Manager for our Performance & Resilience Engineering Platform and I am also the Lead of the Reliability Advocates guild at ING.

My passion’s (at work) are performance testing and engineering (I have more than 20 years’ experience so I am a transformed Dinosaur) as well as service level indicators & objectives and I do love Berlin.
