Process Communication Model (PCM) is one of the most logical tools in
psychological world. It gives people answers, algorithms of approach when
others behave and react in a certain way. There are only 6 types of personality
and only 3 sequences of behaving under stress or pressure. Each of them has a
certain set of steps that will work every single time, if you use it in the
right order. Doesn't it sound tempting to have those steps and reach out to
them every time we deal with other people?

Let's do it together: during the workshop, we are going to work during the
exercises so you practically <b>how to recognize who is on the other side of the
communication process.</b> Why? Because if we tailor our comms, we avoid wasting
time on illogical, insufficient conversations. How much time do you waste on
those right not? I'm sure that it's way too much and you can really use this
time to focus on things that really matter.
