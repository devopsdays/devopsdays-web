In our pursuit of team excellence, we often forget the cornerstone of any
high-functioning team is the well-being and efficiency of its individual
members. It is important to remember, the admonition from in-flight safety
instructions, "put your mask on first before helping others." This lesson is
critical for us, where effectively managing our personal knowledge is akin to
securing our oxygen mask - essential for our survival and success.
