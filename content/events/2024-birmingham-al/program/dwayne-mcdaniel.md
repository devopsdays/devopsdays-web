Someone likely told you to stand up or sit up straight at some point in your
childhood. We buy ergonomic chairs and desks to help us maintain a healthy

for our joint and muscle health. We instinctively understand how to straighten
our stances and spines. But, a new kind of posture has recently emerged that is
not as intuitive: security posture.
