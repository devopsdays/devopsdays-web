In this lightning talk, you’ll hear about the roots of DevOps in the Theory of
Constraints, how 12-Factor principles can guide your microservice and cloud
migration refactor efforts, and how an optimal strategy for the use of Internal
Developer Portals within your organization can tie all of these concepts
together.  We’ll close by looking at the future of DevOps and how platform
engineering is evolving to address the next set of bottlenecks, hiding within
the developer experience.
