Join HashiCorp for a hands-on workshop on zero trust, identity-based security.
During this workshop, participants will learn about the HashiCorp security
model, which is predicated on the principle of identity-based access and
security. After an overview of zero trust security, participants will go
through a hands-on workshop on Vault Advanced Data Protection.

Vault Advanced Data Protection seeks to secure customer data regardless of
where it lives in one's infrastructure. Whether it be through disk/volume
encryption or two-way transformations such as tokenization, Vault ADP minimizes
disruption while providing state-of-the-art data security.

This is a beginner's workshop and no experience is required.

What you will need:
• A computer connected to the internet
• Practical experience with command-line tools and infrastructure as code is helpful
