Secret management is a crucial aspect of DevOps, as it involves the protection
of sensitive data that is used by applications and services. Secrets can
include API keys, credentials, tokens, certificates, and passwords that grant
access to various resources and systems. If these secrets are compromised,
attackers can exploit them to cause damage, steal information, or disrupt
operations.
