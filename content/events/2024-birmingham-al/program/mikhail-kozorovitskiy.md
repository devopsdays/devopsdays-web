DevOps once promised faster deployment and improved collaboration, and in many
ways, it delivered. However, the path was challenging, and many opted for the
easier route: outsourcing, cost-cutting, and ramping up operational
sophistication through AI and decentralization. This predictable combination
has led to high-profile outages, costing billions, yet the lessons remain
unlearned. In this talk, we'll explore a better way forward, rediscovering the
practice and art of DevOps. We'll discuss strategies to move from the brink of
collapse to a rebirthâ€”if you're willing to do the work.
