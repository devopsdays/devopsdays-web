Haystacks Tech has built a functional programming development environment that
can be leveraged to build large enterprise scale automation systems. This has
been accomplished through a number of innovations including 2 new custom design
patterns called CEFL and BRUFL which stand for Configuration Enabled Function
Logging and Business Rules Utility Function Library. Together these design
patterns enable an application to be scaled across large numbers of agile teams
and maintain composition over inheritance programming model and ensure that the
code remain lean and agile at enterprise scale with extremely low code tech
debt, even possible to achieve negative code entropy.
