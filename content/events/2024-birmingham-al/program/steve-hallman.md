Audience discussion and exercise to demonstrate two rounds of common production
assumptions. What factors matter when we want to estimate how long something
will take? And what if we stopped asking for estimates? What could we do
instead? A two-round exercise with "companies" of 5-6 people will create
something simple, under two sets of assumptions, and compare the results. Some
data on what we know about estimates vs. completion times, and how to apply
these principles at work (and home).
