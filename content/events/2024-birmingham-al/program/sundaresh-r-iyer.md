Amazon CodeCatalyst is a unified software development service that makes it
easy for development teams to quickly build and deliver scalable applications
on AWS, while adhering to organizational best practices.

This workshop will focus on how CodeCatalyst project blueprints automatically
set up everything you need to start a new software development project,
including CI/CD, deployable code, issue tracking, and AWS services configured
according to best practices. With custom blueprints, IT leaders can build their
own templates to specify technology to be used by developer teams, control
access to project resources and define testing and building methods.
