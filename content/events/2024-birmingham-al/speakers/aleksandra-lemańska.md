PCM Leadership Mentor & Speaker. Founder of LemanSkills, certified Process
Communication Model® (PCM) Practitioner, Transaction Analyst, HR Consultant,
Facilitator. Certified Change Manager, Action Learning Coach, HBDI and DiSC
Practitioner. A graduate of the Kozminski University in Warsaw (Master in
Management Psychology) and postgraduate studies in Transition Management (also
KU).

She supports Tech Leaders, helping to lead their teams out of the low
engagement zone, using the Process Communication Model® (PCM) and TA Leadership
Method. She works with people on an individual and team level, discovering
sources of low commitment and motivation, thinking holistically about people
and business. Thanks to this, she builds intuitive strategies and tactics
tailored to the specific context, culture and needs to maximize the potential
of people, achieving the intended business results. She strongly believes that
effective communication and ongoing feedback are the key to success and
creating high-performing teams.
