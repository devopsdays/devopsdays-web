DevOpsDays Boston is excited to welcome attendees back in 2024! Unlike 2022 and 2023's events, we will not require proof of vaccination, a recent negative COVID test, or mask wearing, to attend the conference in 2024.

That said, we strongly encourage you to stay home and not try to attend if either of the following are true - in line with the [CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/guidance/respiratory-virus-guidance.html):
1. You are feeling sick on either day of the event.
2. You had a known respiratory infection within five days of the conference, and are still taking medication (fever reducers, antibiotics / antivirals, etc.) to manage the symptoms.

If in doubt, consider wearing a mask. We'll additionally have a small supply of complementary masks available for those who would like one.

In the event that you are not able to attend, please contact us for a full refund for both days, or a partial refund for either/or day.

DevOpsDays Boston may be required to change this policy prior to the conference to align with updated guidance. Updates to this guidance will be e-mailed to all registered attendees. If you are unable to attend or choose not to attend due to a change to this policy, we'd be more than happy to refund your full purchase price.

We're looking forward to seeing you in October!
