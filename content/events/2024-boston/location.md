*Note: a seasonal Boston event called "The Head of the Charles Regatta" from 10/18 (Friday) to 10/20 (Sunday) is causing some elevated pricing in hotels around the area. As such, our organizers have compiled [a list of options by locality](#accommodations) to the DevOpsDays Boston event venue (the Cyclorama on Tremont St., Back Bay) to assist in your search for appropriate accommodations.*
