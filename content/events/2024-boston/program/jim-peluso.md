Let's be honest: adulting is hard, and making decisions is even more challenging. Whether the decisions are at work or just in your life, I'm here to empower you with helpful tools and techniques.

Through this talk, you will learn about the impeccable timing needed to make decisions, how to break down problems before solving them, and how to perform a cost-benefit analysis on the long-term and short-term impact of decisions at work and in life. We will take a real-world example of choosing the right project from this CNCF Landscape chart. https://landscape.cncf.io/
