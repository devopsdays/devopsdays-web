The quality of your testing processes sets the foundation for a stable, high-performing engineering organization. If you can’t trust your deployments, you’re less likely to take risks, push a high volume of features, or tackle difficult tickets. This quickly undermines more than just your software team, it impacts your entire organization – we’ve all seen the global reach of a small bug hitting prod.

Ideally, your CI/CD pipeline and test suite should be complete to the point that your team doesn’t have to extensively monitor or stress about deployments – good testing processes mean that most of this is already taken care of by your tests and infrastructure. In this session, Natalie will talk about what it means to have a “good” test suite, including when and how to employ unit, E2E, integration, and smoke testing. She’ll discuss the role of complete CI/CD pipelines and how they drive safer development patterns. Natalie will also discuss why UAT should never be an afterthought. Afterwards, we’ll see why and how taking this bottom-up approach will positively impact your org’s culture and overall stability.
