Do your symptoms range from frequent headaches, fatigue, to exhaustion and downright nausea? If so, you may be affected by the DevOps recruitment landscape in the past year. In the space, folks have recently been plagued by layoff after layoff, only to face a job market that is brutally unforgiving at the worst of times, and moderately uncomfortable at best.

Industry veterans know that the engineering job market hasn’t in decades seen a reckoning quite like the current one. With millions of dollars spent on new recruitment technology and AI tools, why is the process only deteriorating? In Sabrina's talk, she'll focus on the economics of the engineering job market, the industry lowdown on tech recruitment, and why relationship-driven recruitment is going to be the key to hiring and finding jobs moving forward. Topics will include how to build relationships with recruiters, leverage your network effectively, and navigate a market where the talent supply and demand is off-kilter.

By the end of Sabrina's talk, she hopes developers will feel empowered to build relationships, approach the job market boldly, and embrace the true spirit of DevOps - that is, collaboration to find efficient processes to make engineer’s lives better. Not just from a technical perspective, but professionally as well.
