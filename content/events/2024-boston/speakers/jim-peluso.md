I'm a technologist at heart, but I also enjoy productivity, mentoring, and self-improvement conversations. I've been in the IT industry for over 20+ years and have worked in various positions, from helpdesk to engineering to supervisor to vice president. I'm looking forward to connecting with people at DevOps Days and learning about what the future of DevOps and technology looks like.
