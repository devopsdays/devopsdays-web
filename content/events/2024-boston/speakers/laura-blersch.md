As a late-diagnosed individual with combined ADHD, I've navigated a unique path that's led me to where I am today. I found my way into agile through Scrum and project management while in cultural exchange when I missed being in the classroom after finishing my MBA in Leadership. My diverse experiences outside my professional life extend to being a kids' ski instructor and race coach, reflecting my love for mentorship and skill development. In my free time, I'm an avid skier with an extreme fear of heights, I am making the most of the slopes and facing fears whenever I can. In the summer, I enjoy helping on my sister's farm, where we grow about 2 acres and about 10 varieties of heirloom tomatoes. I embrace the joys of outdoor life and family connections.
