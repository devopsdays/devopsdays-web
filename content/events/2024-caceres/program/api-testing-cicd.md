<p>API Testing has been a challenge for Testers and tools like Postman have made this task easier thanks to the manual creation of request collections. But how can we setup API automated tests using Postman and launch these tests in containers? And CI/CD pipelines?

I will explore 3 key points in automating API tests with usual tools like Postman: the creation of automated tests from Postman, how to run your request collections and their tests using Docker as well as the appropriate containers for them and how API tests are integrated into a CI/CD pipeline in a simple way using Docker & GitlabCI.</p>
