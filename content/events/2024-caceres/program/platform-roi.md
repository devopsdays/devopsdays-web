<h2>Description</h2>
How much platform adoption would increase if we could calculate and showcase upfront our platform ROI? In this talk, we will build together a Platform ROI calculator.

Unlike traditional products, platform require an initial resource investment to be used and the value they deliver it is often times not understood. This can be the biggest barrier for their adoption.

In this talk, we will explore together what is the investment required to start using our platform and what is the value delivered in return.
