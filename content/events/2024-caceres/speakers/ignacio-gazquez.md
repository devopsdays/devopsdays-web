Ignacio is a QA with a wealth of experience working hard in startups from different fields: cybersecurity, fintech, ecommerce, human resources, and also in the video game and adio sector.

His role has always been to solve problems from scratch that go beyond just being a tester coding use cases.

He is a person who is constantly learning, and who has never been afraid of obstacles: he has always tried to solve them in the simplest way to the point where those problems never needed him to be solved again thanks to automation.
A musician in his spare time, he loves playing the piano and producing music, even if that music is not suitable for everyone's ears xD.
