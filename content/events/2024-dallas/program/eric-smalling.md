##### TALK ABSTRACT

Deploying images with minimal filesystem footprints is a known best practice to reduce CVE counts and limit the impact of an exploit or breach. Too many developers choose not to use the most minimal images because they feel the need to have tools to troubleshoot with. Several open source utilities are available to alleviate the need for such tooling from shipping with our images. This session will teach developers and SREs about such tools and the mechanics of how they can be used in various deployment environments.
