##### TALK ABSTRACT

I have worked with clients in various industries that have always tiptoed around CI/CD and were not aware of the reasons causing so much difficulty in the release process. Popping the hood revealed that there were no statistical metrics to measure development lifecycle against. DORA metrics help businesses measure software throughput, quality, and gain insights into how/when development teams can meet business requirements. In my talk i plan to focus on the main pillars in DORA metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery. I will talk about tools used to complete the calculations and what does calculation look like.
