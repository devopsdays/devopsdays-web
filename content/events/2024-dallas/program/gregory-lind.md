##### TALK ABSTRACT

Transparency isn’t just about sharing information; it’s about fostering a culture of openness and honesty. When your team operates with transparency, you create an environment where ideas flow freely and everyone’s voice is heard. At the core of radical transparency is trust. By sharing successes, failures, and progress openly, you’re building a foundation of trust among team members. Trust fuels collaboration and drives innovation.

The inspiration behind my talk and recently released book from Apress Publications, “Radical Therapy for Software Teams,” comes from my 20+ years of experience leading remote software teams and building cloud and cloud-native software. During the talk, I will focus on how transparency and positivity can encourage remote teams to communicate better, prioritize quality, and simplify processes to improve speed and effectiveness.
