##### TALK ABSTRACT

Have you ever wondered how people read a book a day? Or how some of the brightest minds absorb so much knowledge? What if I could give you that superpower to learn everything about the cloud? My talk explores this by applying the AI tool Fabric to digest content and give you the juicy bits to savor.

This talk explores how the newest evolution of interacting with GenAI, Fabric, can give you the power to learn everything about the cloud in 1/10th of the time.
