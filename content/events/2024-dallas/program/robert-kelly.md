##### TALK ABSTRACT

I know what you’re thinking. Does that statement even make sense?

I’ll explain:

Each platform we build is meant to abstract away the complexity or take the place of another platform. We may be building a new interface to abstract away cloud provider complexity or providing tools and services to support developer experience.

Either way, just like any new product entering the market, the platforms we create must provide some level of innovation and value or they won’t succeed in meeting customers (the developers) needs in order to pull them from their existing platforms and processes.

In the truest sense, platforms are a disruptive technology. And like any disruptive technology, there are common traits that enable those products to succeed.

In my talk, I will discuss the traits of disruptive technologies and draw analogies with modern platforms. I will share some points from established sources like “The Innovators Dilemma - Disruptive technologies are both worse and better” and “Team Topologies - The benefits of the Thinnest Viable Platform” and argue that the most important trait of platforms is that they remain small, even if they aren’t. I will explain that no matter how large a platform is, we can build interfaces that feel small and can easily change and evolve with its customers’ (the developers) needs.
