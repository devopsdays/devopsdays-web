As a people leader in Financial Services, my roles have been to build and execute strategies for Financial Institutions and FinTechs seeking to improve their digital customer journeys, product management vision, business processes, and technology ecosystems/architecture. My focus has been on delivering and leading large-scale strategic transformations at FinTechs and Banks in the areas of Payments, Retail Banking, and Core Banking. I have been responsible for business development and sales strategy for FinTech and Retail Banking accounts.

Through this work, I have managed cross-functional global teams focused on solving complex business, technology, risk, and compliance challenges, and worked with a wide range of products such as Mortgages, Credit Cards, Digital Wallets, HELOCs, HEILs and Deposits. I have also designed enterprise architectures across Business, Application, Data, Security, and Infrastructure.

I’m always interested in meeting others in the FinTech, Banking, and Technology spaces, as well as opportunities to partner on entrepreneurial social ventures. Outside of work, I’m looking for recommendations for great podcasts, especially about artificial intelligence or little-known history. I love a great “fun fact.”
