As the CEO and Co-Founder of Buildly, I lead a team of passionate and talented developers who are committed to bringing open source development, processes and AI based learnings to product teams and developers. With over 20 years of experience in software engineering and architecture, I have a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that cloud native solutions offer for building scalable, resilient, and secure applications.

Buildly's core product is an open source gateway and service discovery system that enables users to connect, manage, and create data services, APIs, and endpoints with a single easy-to-use URL. Our platform also provides a flexible UI for building data-driven prototypes and product MVPs in no time. Our mission is to empower developers and product teams to ship faster and better, while leveraging the power and diversity of open source software.

If your an off-shore, near shore and any shore software development agency, marketing or business development agency. Rather then reaching out to me directly on here, go to our marketplace and submit your team and someone with much more capable then me will help you get onboarded.
