I’m a computer scientist who began my career writing compilers, operating systems, and advanced communication software. I led my team to deliver the first commercially available ground-breaking Remote Procedure Call (RPC) technology.

In the middle of my career, I made a pivotal realization: project failures weren’t due to technical hurdles, but rather rooted in managerial and leadership challenges. Determined to rectify this deficiency, I built leadership training programs which I have presented across 6 continents (sorry, Antarctica!), focused on innovation and preparing effective leaders. My enthusiasm lies in instilling engaged leadership skills that resonate with the aspirations of today’s young tech professionals and entrepreneurs. My training programs benefit not only from my background as a computer scientist, but also from my use of real scenarios to engage my audience.

My mission is to empower organizations to go beyond delivering products. My guiding principle? Engaged leaders empower teams, reduce turnover, and drive towards excellence in quality. I care deeply about the lives and careers of software developers, and my work revolves around making their lives and careers great!
