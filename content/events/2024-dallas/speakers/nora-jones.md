Dedicated and driven technology leader and software engineer with a passion for people and reliable software, as well as the intersection between those two worlds.

I truly believe that safety is pivotal with software development nowadays. If we don’t think about the safety and reliability of the product we are building for the humans that use it everyday (from the inception of our idea), then we are presenting a giant problem for humanity. From this passion, I decided to pursue a part-time, advanced degree in Human Factors and Systems Safety; which provides a unique complement to my understanding of how complex software systems fail. 

Learning more about how other industries approach incident analysis, I thought a lot about how the software industry could learn from them -- and ultimately founded Jeli.io, the first incident analysis platform. 

I've had the fantastic opportunity to co-write the book on Chaos Engineering, and how a product’s availability can be improved through intentional failure experimentation (available for free through O'Reilly: http://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/chaos-engineering.csp).

I've also had the opportunity to share my experiences helping organizations large and small, reach crucial availability. In November of 2017 I keynoted at AWS re:Invent to share these experiences with an audience of ~40,000 people. Since then I have keynoted at several other conferences throughout the world highlighting my work on topics such as: Chaos Engineering, Human Factors, Site Reliability, and more.

Reach out to me if you’d like to talk about software, availability, how cultures impact products developed, or English Bulldogs (please leave me an intro when connecting).
