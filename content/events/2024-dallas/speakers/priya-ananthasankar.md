I am a Senior Software Engineer with Microsoft Corporation, working in Azure Core. Over the course of working with the cloud, I have realized that distributed systems and debugging there can be a humbling experience, and solving problems in this space, however common it may be, always presents an adventure. In my free time, standard hobbies apply: reading/walking in the PNW and spending time with my doggo!
