As the VP of Technology Enablement at Liatrio, I lead the technology direction and innovation efforts for our organization and how this translates to value for our customers. I make sure our team of talented consultants are working on "the right thing" and are prepared to bring the best technical solutions to new and existing customers. 

I’m passionate about enabling teams through strong collaboration, an engaging technology platform, and a compelling developer experience. I believe that an “everything as code” and “small-batch & fast-feedback” approach are foundational to building and delivering digital value. 

My background is in software development and delivery, focusing on large, regulated industries. I’ve been fortunate to work with several large banks, healthcare and airlines along with amazing teams of engineers to help IT organizations with their digital transformation and technology modernization journey. The work we do is focused on software delivery and improving the flow of value through improved automation and enabling teams with leading edge technology.
