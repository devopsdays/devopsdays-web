Passionate Software Architect and Change Agent who writes, speaks, teaches, and practices my craft every day. As an accomplished software architect, engineer, DevSecOps, and digital transformation advisor, I've worked across commercial and government clients. Understanding complex problems and working to deliver mission/business value at speed is what drives me. I focus on bringing leading-edge techniques to modern software practices including applying AI/ML/Generative AI to the full software development lifecycle. As a long-time advocate for diversity in technology, I am helping to narrow the diversity gaps as a mentor, sponsor, volunteer, and friend. You can catch me at industry events, on my website, or through podcasts like "Real Technologists" and "It's 505! Daily Podcast". Much of my time is invested as a Senior Principal in MITRE Corporationâ€™s Advanced Software Innovation Center. I hold certifications from Microsoft, AWS, DevOps Institute, PMI, Scrum Alliance, and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).
