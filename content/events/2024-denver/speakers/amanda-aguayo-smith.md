My name is Amanda Aguayo and I am a Mexican-American from Long Beach, California.

After graduating from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, I worked on large advertising campaigns for various clients as part of an Latinx advertising agency. Shortly after,
I began media planning for multiple regions of Mazda Motor Corporation for Mazda North America across 37 markets. I then became Head of Operations for a family operated small business where I oversaw finance, legal, payroll, and compliance. I am now a business owner and Chief Executive Officer of Hunted Labs leading our teams providing outstanding cybersecurity and advisory services to private and public sectors of the United States.

As a Latina leader, I strive to achieve my goals with kindness and perseverance. I enjoy painting and drawing, going to the beach with my husband and kids, and movie nights.
