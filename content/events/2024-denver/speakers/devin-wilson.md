Devin Wilson likes to joke that he is a “fuller stack” software engineer. You’ll find him contributing across backend, frontend, builds, infrastructure, and process. He has always marveled at co-workers that tinker and now he is one of them. When not writing code, you may find him 3D printing, playing mandolin, or flying a kite.
