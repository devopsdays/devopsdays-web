After finishing her Masters degree in Civil Engineering, Eloise decided to move to the software industry.
She started as a backend developer, becoming a group manager and Director, before deciding to move over to the DevOps and infrastructure side, where it is much easier to make an impact at scale.
Since she has to do everything at scale, she has five kids and has run 9 marathons.
