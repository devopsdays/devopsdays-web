Jessica Kerr got into programming because it was easy. Now she loves developing software because it is hard. She cares about learning systems made of learning parts (symmathesy). Currently she works in observability, as Engineering Manager of Developer Relations at [Honeycomb.io](http://honeycomb.io/), remotely from St Louis, MO.
