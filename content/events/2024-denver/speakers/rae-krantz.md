Rae is a tenacious and empathy-driven software engineering leader. Currently, she works at Calendly where she manages a team or two and is in just the right amount of meetings. Outside of paid employment, Rae is a writer, parent and foster parent, triathlete, eternal hobbyist, and wannabe-gardener who enjoys getting dirt under her fingernails.
