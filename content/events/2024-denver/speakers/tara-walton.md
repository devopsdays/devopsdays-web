Tara has been an automation developer for nearly a decade. After years of writing test cases and delivering automated results for clients, she moved into the developer relations space and worked in the Salesforce community. She spent most of her years as an SDET writing API test automation and knows just enough javascript to be dangerous. When Tara isnâ€™t achievement-hunting or playing Dungeons and Dragons, she likes to explore new tech and sing karaoke. She has dual degrees in Math and Computer Science and enjoys sharing her knowledge at global conferences.
