There is a saying that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. When we write a tech blog, we share our knowledge with others and deepen our understanding of the subject. We also improve other skills along the way and build our professional brand and signature.


In this workshop, we will discuss the benefits of writing a blog and try to remove all the barriers that have stopped us so far from writing a blog. Together we will think about topics to write about and start our draft. And hopefully, after this workshop, you will be inspired to continue your journey to become a tech blogger and publish a tech blog.
