Let’s face it PAM (AKA privileged access management) was built for servers from circa 20 years ago.

The cloud-native ecosystem has evolved significantly since its early days, in tandem with the increased sophistication of modern threat actors and the exploit landscape. This begs the question, why are organizations still protecting their most sensitive assets and accounts with access control that is optimized for legacy systems?

In this talk we’ll walk through the evolution from on-prem to the modern cloud, focusing on the four core elements that impact your security posture when it comes to privileged cloud resources: connectivity, authentication, fine-grained authorization (FGA), and visibility. We’ll demonstrate through real examples where PAM breaks down and just-in-time access comes in to level up your cloud security. We’ll wrap up with better practices when it comes to access control for modern cloud environments.

You’ll come away from this session with practical ways to de-escalate unnecessary privileges, lower costs, reduce man-in-the-middle (MITM) as well as single points of failure, and hopefully provide you with some peace of mind when it comes to your cloud security. 

- After an AD/IDP, privileged access management (PAM) is the most common piece in an average IAM stack
- It’s how organizations protect their most sensitive assets and accounts
- It was built for systems we had around 20 years ago. 
- Privileged cloud resources require different practices

This talk will cover the technology challenges and how to migrate from former implementations to newer and better implementations built for the cloud native world
