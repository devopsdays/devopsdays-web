Do you know that moment when someone says something biased to you, and you struggle to reply? So you don't say anything and when the moment is gone, you think about all the different saucy replies you could have given.
This collaborative and interactive workshop will help you to expand your repertoire of replies and refine your “answer to biased comments” technique.
