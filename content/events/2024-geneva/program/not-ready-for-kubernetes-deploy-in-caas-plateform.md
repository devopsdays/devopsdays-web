Let’s see how quickly we can get started with container-based deployments without the hassle of a full blown Kubernetes cluster. 
We’ll start from a standard web application based on Spring Boot and Angular and demonstrate the automated build and deployment process. 

While vendor-specific – Google Cloud Run for this example – we’ll also see an alternative using Hidora and jelastic.

The goal of this short talk is to spark discussions on how to quickly deploy early releases of a new application, in order to decide whether to eventually upgrade to a “real” container infrastructure.
