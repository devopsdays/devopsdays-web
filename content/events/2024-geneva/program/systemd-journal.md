Title = "A powerful logs management solution we all have and use, but we underestimate: systemd-journal"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["costa-tsaousis"]
+++

The proposed talk aims to unearth the potent features of systemd-journal that have remained mostly underutilized and largely underappreciated within the SRE community.

The focus will be on its ability to handle dynamically structured log entries, its inherent support for centralized logging, and its robust security features including log sealing.
