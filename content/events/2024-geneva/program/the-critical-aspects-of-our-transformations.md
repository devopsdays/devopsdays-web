Title = "The critical aspects of our transformations (DevOps, Agile, Ecological)"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["sylvain-garabiol"]

DevOps, Agile, Ecological. Three areas where we are used to hear about the transformation at hand and how it's currently running, but most of the time we go too deep into the implementation details in those contexts before even drawing out the bigger picture and making sure we have a common and shared understanding of the current situation, of the goals we should aim for, and avoid confusing those mindset oriented solutions for the small mechanical bits they carry with them.
