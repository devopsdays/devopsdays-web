“What if Joey Tribbiani from 'Friends' was right: I like it. What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good."
When two women: Laetitia AEGERTER: Human Resources Manager in charge of L&D turned Agile Coach, joins a Software department. And Edwige FIACLOU: Senior Software Engineer Manager, formerly in charge of the Trading System for a FinTech (with particularly demanding clients) decide to cook up a menu. Agility and DevOps become a beautiful culinary adventure.

Through this menu, Laetitia and Edwige will present their recipe for successful DevOps. They will answer questions that every engineer faces when DevOps becomes necessary such as: How can we reconcile the speed of delivery with the security of applications and data? What about DevOps: Are we allowed to fail? How can I improve DevOps performance in two separated worlds? Can we be creative and efficient in the pragmatic world of DevOps? In conclusion, during this presentation, the two speakers will provide innovative and concrete ideas for a recipe combining Agility, Dev, and Ops.”
