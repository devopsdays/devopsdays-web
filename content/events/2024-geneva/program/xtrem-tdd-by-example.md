You have probably already heard of, or practised, Test-Driven Development (TDD) but have you already tried it in an Xtrem way?

What do we mean by Xtrem?

We propose practising TDD on a kata using mob programming and introducing different constraints at different points.

We expect you to find intelligent ways to overcome those constraints.

Those constraints can be of different types: Design, Testing, Practice, and Architecture.

Here are some examples of constraints that we have documented on our website :
– Let's Mutate Some Code
- Implement Portfolio
- Fight Primitive Obsession
- No For Loops
- Use Only Immutable Types
- Avoid Exceptions
- Use an existing monad
- Use Property-Based Testing to challenge our Domain Model
- Add an Acceptance Test
- Functional Core, Imperative Shell
– and much more …

By overcoming those constraints, you will learn new ways of designing your code that you can use daily.
