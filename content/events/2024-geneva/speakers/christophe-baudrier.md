Passionate about IT from an early age and a pathological "disrupter", I embarked on a technical career in a number of companies, where I had the opportunity to develop my technical and managerial skills. I also had a big and successful encounter with Quality Assurance and Governance, which are now my favorite subjects, and whose stakes are now being expressed loud and clear for companies wishing to make their transformation to achieve their compliance objectives. My latest playground is helping small and medium-sized businesses, as well as major corporations, to make the transition to DevSecOps.
