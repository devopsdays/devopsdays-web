I'm a senior developer at 56K.Cloud with close to 10 years of experience. After studying mechanical engineering I switched career paths and went into software development where I developed many cross-platform mobile and desktop applications. Overtime these applications relied more and more on cloud-native serverless backends built on hyperscaler cloud platforms. I now focus my time as a Cloud-Native Consultant for 56k.Cloud helping clients migrate to or optimize their existing cloud infrastructure.
Besides my work as a cloud-native consultant, I've been giving for many years now courses at the Masters level at the HES-SO in Lausanne and the ZHAW in Zurich on a wide range of topics ranging from microservice vs monolith architectures to CI/CD pipelines.
