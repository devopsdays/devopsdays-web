All submissions will be reviewed blindly, meaning that the program committee is unable to see the submitterâ€™s personal details. Only the title of the talk and the describing abstract will be visible to the reviewers in order to reduce unconscious bias. After all talks are rated, we will inform you about the status of your submission. Talks can either be accepted, rejected or waitlisted. In case your talk is waitlisted, we will message you if a speaking slot opens up before the conference.<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Visit [this website](https://talks.devopsdays.org/devopsdays-halifax-2024/cfp) to submit your talk.
