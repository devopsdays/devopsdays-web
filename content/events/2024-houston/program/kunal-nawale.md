Logs and metrics give you a basic view of what's happening in your app. But with OpenTelemetry you can add distributed tracing in your app. In this talk we give you an overview of how easy it is to add visibility into your app in a few steps. This will help you find which endpoint or microservice is performing the slowest, debugging errors that a small percentage of your users are experiencing and much more. OpenTelemetry paired with open source observability tools is a sweet combination. By using free open source software and a little bit of effort on your side you can completely change how your app behaves in real world
