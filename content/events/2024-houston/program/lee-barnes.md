Performance testing isn't the first thing organizations think about when moving to DevOps - in fact, it's often ignored as traditional approaches don't jive well with the fast and nimble world of DevOps. However, performance is still a critical part of the user experience, and poor performance and outages will quickly negate the value of the features you're delivering. Lee believes that organizations don't have to gamble with application performance. He will discuss techniques for implementing continuous performance testing in your pipeline, so you don't have to roll the dice on your user experience. Topics will include performance testing activities at each stage of the pipeline - from the unit level through testing in production. You will also learn how to rethink your approach to performance testing and work with your DevOps practices instead of against them in areas like test environment and data management. You'll walk away with a new outlook on performance testing in DevOps and ideas you can begin to implement in your pipeline.
