New technologies keep us ever more tightly bound up with our devices. As these apps and interfaces demand more of our day and more days of our life the need increases for IT practitioners to learn when - and more importantly HOW - to walk away. 

Most importantly of all, it requires we do so without creating unacceptable pressures when we turn our devices back on.

Over a decade ago I started disconnecting for one day every week - totally unplugging. Not just me, but my whole family. Spoiler: This did not, in fact, drive us to the brink of madness.

This talk is for anyone who has ever considered taking a break from tech, whether for an hour, a day, or longer; or anyone who heard about people who disconnect and called them freaky crazy luddites, whether to their face or behind their back.
