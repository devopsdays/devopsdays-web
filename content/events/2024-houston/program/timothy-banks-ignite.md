We spent a year creating a documentary on the DevOps community, leaning heavily into the kubernetes community space to do so. We learned an incredible amount about what people are doing with kubernetes and the ways it enables them. More importantly, though, we learned that the community has a wealth of concerns about the present and future of kubernetes, including what should come next. Hear about this journey and what we found, and why the people of the kubernetes community continue to be its most valuable asset.
