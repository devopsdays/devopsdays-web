Andrew Clay Shafer has been helping developers carry pagers for the last decade after having a caffeine induced vision while servers burned around him. Before that he was baptized in the fountain of Agile by a cult of cave dwelling witch doctors as a software developer with a background in math modeling and computational science. Devops has been very good to Andrew and he has tried to return the favor.
