Eric is a Senior Solutions Engineer at HashiCorp. Over the course of his career, he was a principal engineer for 17 years at a SaaS shop in Houston that scaled from a half-rack of servers to a fully automated multi-region hybrid cloud environment with over 25PB of storage under management. He is a relentless advocate for end-to-end automation and the organizational alignment required to achieve it. These days, he pulls from his practical experience to have meaningful conversations with both practitioners and leaders as a Solutions Engineer. He is a recovering musician/DJ, an active audio/video nerd, and a father in his “spare time”.
