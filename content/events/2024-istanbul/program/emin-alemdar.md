Let's talk about the elephant in the room - OpenTofu. During this talk we will explore the background of this project, why it was created, the milestones from first days until today. We will also discuss if OpenTofu is really a drop-in replacement for Terraform and we will discuss if this is the time to migrate to this project now and what might happen in the future.
