## About the space

The **[Madrid Theatre](https://www.madridtheatre.com/)** is a beautifully renovated, multi-purpose theatre that has been home to hundreds of weddings, corporate events, fundraisers, and concerts since its opening in 1926.
 
Rich in history since its inception, the Madrid Theatre has been the home base to several different businesses. What started out as a Spanish revival-style silent movie house boomed until the 1930’s when billionaire tycoon, Howard Hughes, bought it up and ran it as a full movie house for the next decade. In 1944, the theatre closed and sat idle until the 50’s, when it was purchased, gutted, and resuscitated as a storage warehouse.
 
It wasn’t until 1983 when Victor Patti had the vision of restoring this architectural artwork to its original grandeur and purchased it with that intention, and by the beginning of 2000, the hard work was well underway.  At long last, in 2001, 75 years after its grand opening, the Madrid Theatre reopened its doors to the public.
