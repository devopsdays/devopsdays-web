The general trend in the industry is shifting towards cloud repatriation, this shift has caused what I call a knowledge gap where engineers are only familiar with interacting with infrastructure via APIs but not the hardware or networks their application runs on. In this talk I aim to demystify on-prem environments and show engineers how easy and smooth it is to repatriate data from cloud to an on-prem air gap environment.
