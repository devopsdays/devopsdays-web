Title = "The IaC Tooling Face-off for Modern Cloud Native Ops"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["asaf-blubshtein"]

With Infrastructure as Code becoming the de facto way we manage our infrastructure today, a lot of excellent tools have become widely adopted that each have a different set of strengths. In this talk we'd like to take a look at the evolution of the IaC landscape over the past decade, and where we're heading.

We'll examine some of the biggest Ops - DevOps / SRE / Platform - engineering challenges through the lens of IaC including disaster recovery, security, cost, performance and even where complexity factors in when choosing your tooling of choice. While many of us have already chosen our tooling, we may also like to consider migration and integration of multiple tools for different use cases and stacks. In this interactive talk, we'll allow you to decide which tools we explore - from CDK to Pulumi, Terraform, OpenTofu, Helm, ArgoCD to learn about how they stack up versus modern cloud native challenges.
