When it comes to building a resilient and high-performing API platform, it’s crucial to understand that success is not solely dependent on the technology you use. During this talk, we will:

1. Discuss the recently released Platform engineering maturity model
2. Explore the intersection of people, processes, and products for platform success
3. Understand the metrics that matter for platform success

API platforms provide an API-first, self-service way of delivering and maintaining the applications that an organisation needs to grow its business. However, every organisation’s maturity is different, every team’s needs are different and subsequently, their definition of success is different!

So, how do you assess your organisation’s maturity and platform needs? What determines the success of such API platforms? What might you be missing? Tune in to find out!
