It is easy for documentation with our projects to get stale. This can especially be true with diagrams. This powerful visualization that illustrates our systems, can quickly become misleading when they become out of date. What if we could make it easier to maintain visualizations of our systems, by removing the burden of classical diagramming tools or forcing people into a presentation building tool to illustrate their system?

Treating our documentation like code can be applied to how we build diagrams, through textual languages that can represent our systems. Quickly get a taste of how you can get started diagramming with code to communicate about your systems. After this talk, you will learn how you can stay in your code editor and build powerful diagrams with a consistent look and feel, enabling you to quickly communicate about your systems through illustration.
