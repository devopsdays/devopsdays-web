Mentorship is important to build into your organization. In order to maintain a cohesive culture of your organization, you must pass on a legacy. Mentorship allows you to impart values, creates a cohesive culture and shares experiential wisdom. Creating a caring, diverse, supportive environment allows your team to build the skills and attitudes they need for success. In this presentation, you will learn the Four Deadly Sins of Mentorship that will make or break your organization.

Mentorship can come from people in the same industry, people of varying ages and through various communication methods (in-person, email, video conferencing, etc.). Mentorship experiences can happen once or multiple times throughout the year. Mentorship is more about guiding others through challenging experiences that youâ€™ve already experienced than it is about telling someone what to do.
