In this talk, Mark and his son, Benjamin, will demonstrate pair programming and test driven development by live coding a simple algorithm. If you've heard about how pair programming and TDD work, but haven't ever seen it in successful practice, this demonstration should clear up some common misconceptions and give you an idea of how it might be useful to you and your team.
