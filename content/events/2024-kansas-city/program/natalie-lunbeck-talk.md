CI/CD is now considered table stakes for any modern software team. The reality, however, is quite different: DevOps and SRE teams are constantly struggling to keep static testing and staging environments up and running. If teams don't have a place to test and validate their code how can they possibly release it, let alone continuously?

Ephemeral environments have coalesced as the solution for FAANG and are starting to pick up steam for everyone else. Short-lived, isolated, and disposable environments allow DevOps and SRE teams to stop worrying about broken environments blocking deployments.

Join Natalie as she shares best practices for implementing ephemeral environments and understanding their benefits to unblock your CI/CD.  She will cover test before merge, security, cost control, and ideal developer workflows.
