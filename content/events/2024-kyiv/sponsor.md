DevOpsDays Ukraine is a charity edition of the conference. We are inviting the whole world to talk about DevOps, disaster recovery, and adapting. All proceeds will go toward local, Ukrainian-led charities. The event aims to highlight the war in Ukraine, support Ukrainian DevOps specialists, and collect donations to support all Ukrainian people.
