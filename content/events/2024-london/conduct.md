The Code of Conduct applies to all participants at devopsdays London. Including attendees, speakers, sponsors, suppliers, volunteers, organisers and guests.

### Report contact details
Our team members are identifiable by their purple devopsdays London t-shirts and can always be approached. We will always have someone available on the welcome desk and we also have a staffed phone and email address for reporting issues.
Our team is available during all official events, including the speaker dinner and the social event(s), and our designated contacts stay sober throughout our events.

### Our standards & values
Inclusiveness and respect for differences are core DevOps values, and we invite you to help us make this event a place that is welcoming and respectful to all participants. Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Don’t judge and make assumptions just because someone is different whether in some visible way or in their lived experience. We ask everybody to treat each other with respect.

### Prohibited conduct

Conference staff can be identified by distinct purple t-shirts.
