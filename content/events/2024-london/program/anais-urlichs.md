At most technical conferences, you expect to hear technical talks in which technological solutions are presented to your technical problems. In a way, this is similar to fighting fire with fire and hoping to extinguish your problems. Whether you are struggling with data protection, security incidents or runtime performance of your services, all your concerns can be addressed through technical solutions. However, just because you can do something does not mean you always should. 

Anais is here to discuss how technical problems can be addressed through better writing and, subsequently, how investing in the writing skills of your engineers can save you time and money. This does not only include documentation but also runbooks, blog posts, guides, use cases, post-mortems and more.
