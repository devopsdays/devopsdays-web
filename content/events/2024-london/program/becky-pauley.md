The Cloud can be an amazing - and expensive - place. So how do we stay in control?

From our learnings in the field, this talk gives a lightning-speed introduction to the world of cost-optimisation: from common gotchas and misconceptions, to the changes that really make a difference. 

Expect to come away with a new way of thinking about efficient cost-optimisation: especially our approach to cost savings, visibility and cloud waste.
