For so many of us who work in open source, we’re emotionally invested in our projects, and we have little to no separation between our volunteer/professional and personal lives. That’s a problem. Let’s take five minutes to understand that we do our best work when we’re feeling healthy and happy. We're going to talk about boundaries, and about wilful disconnection, and how to make sure that you feel _good_ about you, your code, and your community.

…and we’re going to do it whilst pretending that we're on a Shakespearian stage (no, seriously).
