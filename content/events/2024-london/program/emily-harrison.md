I have found it very interesting to see peoples reactions to the experiences I had in the start of my career in tech in the 1990s. I thought it would be interesting for others to hear what it was like as a strong, intelligent and hard working woman to work in a male dominated industry, challenged with misogyny and bias on my journey to now.  The industry has changed so much but it is so important for people to see how far we have come and where we can still go.
