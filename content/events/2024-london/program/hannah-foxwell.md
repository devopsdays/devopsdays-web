I once knew a CIO who told his team to “Stop talking to me about DevOps”. That quote didn’t age so well.

It’s funny because recently someone told me to “Stop talking about AI” …but I won’t shut up about it. And nor should you.

I’ll admit there’s too much hype around AI. There are unintended consequences, embarrassing hiccups and ethical issues abound. There are also small glimpses of what the future might look like.

What can the next technology transformation learn from the transformations that came before it? What experience have we gained from over 15 years of DevOps Transformation that might help us with AI today?
