DevOps is critical to most companies one way or another now but in this case this is the story of how DevOps and cultural change became critical to ensuring airplanes keep taking off in a major European airline. Going from the beginnings of the standard DevOps anti-pattern to a modern and enlightened organisation doing DevOps daily and even covering how DevOps is done in the mainframe (and has been for a long time). This talk will cover the tools involved but will be focused on the cultural changes required to make DevOps work.
