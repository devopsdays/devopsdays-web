Continuous learning is increasingly regarded as a key differentiator of high performing software teams, but what does that actually mean in practice and how can we optimise socio-technical systems for learning?

In this talk I'll dig into the characteristics of a learning system and share examples of social and technical practices that can support continuous learning in software teams.

We'll also consider the role we play as individual contributors to collective learning and the steps we can take independently to become better learning citizens.

This talk will inspire you to reflect on your personal and collective learning capabilities and experiment with different ways of supporting continuous learning in your team and across your organisation.
