Adrienne is a Filipina software engineer, international speaker, author of Coding for Kids: Python, and a LinkedIn Learning instructor...essentially, an overachiever. She's currently writing "Looks Good To Me: Constructive Code Reviews", a labour of love that she hopes will improve code reviews everywhere. Most importantly, she spends way too much money on coffee, desserts, and vintage clothing and ungodly amounts of time playing Age of Empires II.
