A self-taught engineer and career changer, Becky made the leap from teaching to tech four years ago. She’s since worked in Platform and Cloud Engineering roles, with a focus on Kubernetes best practices and Cost-Optimisation. As well as all things Cloud Native, she’s passionate about ways of working, learning and community. In particular, she loves taking technical concepts and making them simple to understand. Becky also loves a challenge- and outside of work you’ll find her surfing, bouldering or hiking.
