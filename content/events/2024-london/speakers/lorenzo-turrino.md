The speaker has been working in Platform/DevOps/cloud for the past 5 years or so, and as a software developer before that, and now working as Lead DevOps engineer at a fintech/regtech company.
[They] have a keen interest in observability as a tool to avoid outages and maintain a healthy platform - and sane engineers.
