Rob Lazzurs is currently the CTO of an aviation focused cloud consultancy called Amach.
With over 20 years experience covering ISPs, building early Cloud providers, Digital Transformation in Government and now leading Cloud and AI in aviation he has seen a lot of DevOps and all the anti-patterns.
Keeping the user needs in focus at all times has been his goal and led to a clear focus on helping people work together to make technology work for people.
