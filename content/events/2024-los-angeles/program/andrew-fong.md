<p>
Andrew will discuss his experience building continuous delivery systems through the hypergrowth phase of engineering organizations. He will focus on the lessons and principles he has learned at YouTube and Dropbox where he saw systems scale exponentially in headcount and system scale. He will discuss how those principles shaped his opinions of building a great developer experience that "defaults to fast."
