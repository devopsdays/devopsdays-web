Calling all SoCal DevOps enthusiasts and practitioners! DevOpsDaysLA is your platform to share and learn. 

There are three ways to propose a topic at DevOpsDaysLA: 
<p>

- <strong>Conference Talk</strong>: A detailed 30-40 minute talk during the main event.
- <strong>Lightning Talk</strong>: A quick, impactful 10-minute talk.
- <strong>Open Space</strong>: If you'd like to lead or participate in a group discussion during the attendee-suggested Open Space lunch session, it is not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in person at the conference.

If you'd like to demo your product or service, you should sponsor the event and demo it at your table.

We invite you to submit your presentations on how the human factor enables, enhances, and optimizes various processes, such as:

- Automation
- Testing
- Security
- Platform Engineering
- Reliability
- Organizational Culture
- CI/CD
- DevOps Practices
- Career Development in SoCal

Our longstanding tradition continues, thanks to the SCaLE 21x team, who graciously donate the Pasadena Convention Center venue space, as well as their Call for Presenters submission process for our community's use.

Be a part of the global DevOpsDays series and contribute to the vibrant SoCal tech community. Your voice matters, and we can't wait to hear it! 

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:
<p>

- <strong>Broad appeal</strong>: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.

- <strong>New local presenters</strong>: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.

- <strong>Under-represented voices</strong>: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you’re in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you’re in a large, traditional organization, or you’re the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
original content: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn’t likely to have already seen.

- <strong>No third-party submissions</strong>: This is a community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you’ve already shown that as a speaker, you’re distant from the process.

- <strong>No vendor pitches</strong>: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we will not accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
