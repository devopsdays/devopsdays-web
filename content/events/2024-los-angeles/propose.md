How to Submit a Proposal

If you have a SCaLE CFP tool login from speaking at a previous SCaLE event, you can re-use your login. You don’t need to sign up for a new one.

Visit https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/user/ to log in or create a login if necessary. To create your login, enter details in the form such as name, bio, email address of the speaker, etc. Please ensure that the personal biography is not more than 1000 characters; focus on relevant experience to your proposal topic and write from the third-person perspective. Note that the contact email-address is the one that will be used to confirm the login creation and speaker registration.

Once registration is complete, an email will be automatically sent to the email address to set the password for subsequent access.

To submit a talk, please go to the link labeled Submit a presentation: (You need to log in first to see the Submit link) Enter the title for the talk, the intended audience and <strong>the proposed track for this talk</strong>(in this case please indicate <strong>DevOpsDays LA</strong>). Then provide a brief description of the main points to be presented. Include additional details in the space provided. Also, include the names of all speakers that will present this session. Each speaker must have a login in the system before they can be entered in the ”speaker” field.

Once the talk has been submitted, further edits to the submission can be made, if necessary, up to the CFP closing date by logging into the account with the credentials provided during login creation. Be sure to include an email for the primary contact for the presentation. Important information will be sent to that address.

For submitting multiple talks for the same speaker, the step above may be repeated; note that you don’t need to create another speaker login.

Please notify us if the presentation will require a special technical set-up. The setup provided will include:

- One microphone
- A digital projector with HDMI cable

Proposal abstracts are reviewed by an expert committee and evaluated solely on merit. Given the number of high quality submissions received every year, we request that submission dates be strictly honored in order to provide the committee enough time to choose the best set of proposals. In case you run into any problems during the submission process, please email cfp@socallinuxexpo.org for help.

Notes for Speakers
Presentations will be allotted a time slot of about 45 minutes (except workshops and upSCaLE talks).
Please ensure that presentations are done in an open non-proprietary format.
All SCaLE speakers are in-person. We do not have the capability to support virtual presentations.
Please indicate in the “Message to the reviewers” field if you need any additional accommodation in order to give your presentation effectively.
Please indicate in the “Message to the reviewers” field if you have a significant financial constraint. We have a limited budget for sponsorship of speakers who are selected but cannot join us without financial support.
