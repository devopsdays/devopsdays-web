<p>
Dave's favorite questions are, how does it work, how can I help and how can we make it beautiful and he's been using these questions to guide him throughout his life.  Going back to his childhood days plunking away at his Pop's IBM 5150 or Grandpa's TRS 80 he's been fascinated with technology and parlayed that early experience into various engineering positions at Sun Microsystems, Oracle and many others after.  More recently you'll find him talking about his love of abstractions and how they relate to computing in the form of the cloud... Kubernetes, Containers, Jails, LDOMS, oh my.  He has strong opinions, held weakly and believes that honest, vigorous debate is the ideal way to acquire knowledge.  He's no stranger to the stage or spotlight and looks forward to contributing SCALE as a presenter.
