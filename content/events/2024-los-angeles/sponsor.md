<h3>About DevOpsDaysLA</h3>

<p>
DevOpsDaysLA, now in its 13th year, is Southern California's only annual conference focused on the practice of DevOps. The conference provides a relaxed, casual, and diverse environment where sponsors connect with talent, demonstrate the latest tools, and offer world class services to facilitate organizations' DevOps journey. 

<h3>DevOpsDaysLA Conference Profile</h3> 

- 500 to 800 Attendees (Our 2024 goal is 800-1000 attendees) - Typically composed of developers, experienced engineers, curious business leaders, students, and educators
- 8 Speakers (5 Long Form Talks, 3 Lightning Talks)
  - 33% of Speakers are typically women 
  - 18 Sponsors (90% gold packages + exclusives such as after-party, lunch, etc)

<p>
There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. We'll have sponsors for various events with special privileges for the sponsors of these events. If you are interested in special sponsorships or have a creative idea about how you can support the event, send us an email.

The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
