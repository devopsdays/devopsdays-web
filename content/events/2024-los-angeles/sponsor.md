<p>
Now in its 13th year, DevOpsDayLA is Southern California’s only annual conference focused on the practice of DevOps - a proven, joint approach that emphasizes the need for collaboration between the Software Development (Dev) and Operations/IT Infrastructure (Ops) teams within an organization to continually deliver high-quality solutions.

It is a part of the worldwide series of DevOpsDays events held annually, sanctioned, and supported by the DevOpsDays global core team. DevOpsDayLA is volunteer-organized and offers a variety of opportunities to learn and share experiences about how the human factor enables, enhances, and optimizes technological processes, with a focus on :

- Automation
- Testing
- Security
- Platform Engineering
- Reliability
- Organizational Culture
- CI/CD
- Devops Practices
- And Career Development

DevOpsDayLA sponsors have the opportunity to offer job opportunities, demonstrations of the latest tools, and world-class service offerings to facilitate organizations' DevOps journey. The conference is presented with the support of the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE). It provides a relaxed, casual, and diverse environment where experienced professionals, evangelists, agile practitioners, developers, job seekers, business executives, educators, students, and curiosity seekers can connect and attend talks on current topics.

For additional information, please contact us at los-angeles@devopsdays.org.

<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
