<h3>Become A Volunteer</h3>

<p>
DevOpsDaysLA, now in its 13th year, is Southern California's only annual conference focused on the practice of DevOps - a proven, joint approach that emphasizes the need for collaboration between the Development (Dev) and Operations/IT (Ops) teams within an organization to continually deliver high-quality solutions. The conference provides a relaxed, casual, and diverse environment where experienced professionals, evangelists, agile practitioners, developers, job seekers, business executives, educators, students, and curiosity seekers can connect and attend talks on current topics. DevOpsDaysLA sponsors offer job opportunities, demonstrations of the latest tools, and world-class service offerings to facilitate organizations' DevOps journey. The conference typically attracts 800 people.

<p>
We are seeking enthusiastic volunteers to help with conference setup, attendee management, and put away. Volunteering offers substantial career development benefits including:

- Introductions to seasoned technology leaders & professionals
- Opportunities to hear talks
- Exceptional resume experience
- Strong differentiation when applying for internships

<p>
The conference will provide volunteers with breakfast, lunch, and snacks throughout the day. They will also receive a special "Thank You" swag gift.
