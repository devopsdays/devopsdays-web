While I am not an expert in software or DevOps, I do play a lot of soccer. Soccer is a dynamic, continuous team-based sport. In this talk, I'll explore how that's actually a lot like DevOps. There are different positions, but everyone has to work together and step up at the right times. An important takeaway for folks is a reminder that everyone is on the same team and everyone has to work together for DevOps to work. At least, I'm pretty sure that's true.
