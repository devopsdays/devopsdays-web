Emma is a DevOps and Cloud Operations Engineer at Dispatch, headquartered in Bloomington, MN. She spends her time managing Kubernetes clusters, writing CI/CD tools, and maintaining cloud infrastructure. In her spare time, she channels her inner child by designing and building with LEGO sets, collecting American Girl dolls and books (which she started collecting at age four), playing pickleball, and reading booksâ€”usually fiction, often murder mysteries, ideally from the local library.
