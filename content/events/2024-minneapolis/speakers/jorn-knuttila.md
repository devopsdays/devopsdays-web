Jorn is a bearded, bumbling Nordic geek from the frozen tundra surrounding Minneapolis, MN (a suburb of Canada, doncha know!) playing Solution Engineer at NeuVector by SUSE. Understanding the business behind the technology makes Jorn a uniquely qualified guide to the container security journey. With over 30 years in IT, at industry leaders like IBM, Rundeck, CenturyLink and Savvis, and experience as a practitioner, Jorn has lots of stories about ruining things on the Internet before there even was an Internet, uphill both ways, in the snow. After many years doing really big things at really big companies, he's disturbingly excited about being a part of the awesomeness that is Suse. Ask him why.
