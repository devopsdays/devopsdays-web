I'm a Professor at [Macalester College](http://www.macalester.edu/) in St. Paul and a [Principal Scientist at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/office-of-applied-research/). As a teacher, I strive to convey the joys of computer science to undergraduates and prepare them for their lives after graduation. As a researcher, I build systems that empower people to be better contributors to online communities.

My research draws on techniques from data-mining, interface design, and social science to encourage members to contribute better content to their communities, and enable communities to identify high-quality contributions from members. I also currently serve as a Principal Scientist for Microsoft Corporation, helping them develop AI systems that advance products such as Microsoft Outlook.

I received my Ph.D. under John Riedl at the University of Minnesota with [GroupLens Research](https://grouplens.org/). Before that, I worked at Sourcelight Technologies, a startup that built movie recommenders for companies like Blockbuster Video and Comcast. I have also worked for Google, IBM Research, Thomson Reuters R & D, and Target Corporation.

When not teaching or researching, I play jazz saxophone, squash, and spend time with my family.
