Susan is a DeWitt Wallace Professor of Computer Science, as well as chair of the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science department at Macalester. Her research combines artificial intelligence, robotics, computer vision, and machine learning: her current research project uses deep learning models to determine where a robot is in its world, given a picture from the robot's camera. Susan teaches a broad range of courses, including the first introductory course, algorithms and theory, computer systems, as well as advanced courses in AI and robotics. She also works with high school students on research in computer vision, as well as an interdisciplinary exploration of artificial intelligence.
