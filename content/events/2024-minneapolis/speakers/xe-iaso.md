I'm Xe Iaso, I'm a technical educator, conference speaker, twitch streamer, vtuber, and philosopher that focuses on ways to help make technology easier to understand and do cursed things in the process. I live in Ottawa with my husband and I do developer relations professionally. I am an avid writer for my blog, where I have over 400 articles. I regularly experiment with new technologies and find ways to mash them up with old technologies for my own amusement.
