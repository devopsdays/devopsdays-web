Title = "Enabling Product Thinking for Terraform Modules with OpenTelemetry (and OpenTofu)"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["blair-drummond"]
+++

Many organizations have reusable terraform modules â€” but how much insight do they have into how those terraform modules are used, and by whom? Using OpenTelemetry, we show how we can instrument OpenTofu in order to derive these product usage metrics automatically, enabling platform teams to see critical modules metrics such as version adoption, error rates, and drift detection. We show applications of this to Github Actions and the Weaveworks TF-Controller. Source Code will be made available.
