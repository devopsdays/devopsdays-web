Participants in the workshop will get first hand experience in setting up containers with various functions.
Finally, everyone would learn what are the pros and cons for the different setups shown during the workshop.

If you have questions regarding cGroups, Namespaces, network connection options for containers or storage options. Marian will try to answer all of your questions, during this very hands on workshop.

Participants are expected to be able to use SSH to executed commands on remote machines.
If you plan to build this on your computer a VM with recent Ubuntu will be preferable.
