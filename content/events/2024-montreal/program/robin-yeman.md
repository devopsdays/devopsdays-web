In an era where we expect to see more growth in space in the next 5 years than we have in the last 50 years its critical that we can adapt to changing needs and deliver faster while ensuring we are safe and secure. The Space domain is no different, where multiple countries are working lead space exploration and be the first to land on Mars.

The application of Industrial DevOps into space exploration represents a monumental leap. Where we can leverage Agile and DevOps practices to adapt to change and speed up delivery both safely and securely in the realm of space exploration. Industrial DevOps pulls from multiple bodies of knowledge including Systems Thinking, Model Based Engineering, Agile, DevOps, Cyber. We need to use all of the tools in our toolbox to reach the moon first and then leap to Mars.

This presentation is for Space enthusiast, Executive Leadership, Engineering Managers, Architects, and those passionate about test. At the close of this presentation you will understand new entrants in the Space market are driving the industry to move faster. Pragmatic approaches for applying Agile and DevSecOps to large-scale, safety-critical, cyber-physical systems and results from case studies where Agile and DevOps has been successfully applied to space missions.
