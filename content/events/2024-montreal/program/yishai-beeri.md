Title = "A DORA Metrics Adventure in Deciphering Engineering Changes"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["yishai-beeri"]
+++

DORA metrics have now been widely adopted by progressive engineering organizations to provide hard data on the health of engineering delivery through the lens of speed and quality. In this talk, I'd like to share some practical use cases that can help you navigate complex engineering organizations processes and decisions with the help of DORA metrics.

In a choose your own adventure style talk, where the audience decides what climactic journey to explore, you'll be able to learn about how DORA metrics can help engineering leaders measure the outcome and impact of common engineering organization challenges. You'll get to choose from acquisitions and M&As, RIFs, firefighting and engineering quality hellholes, restructuring and reorgs, and more. Come to this talk for an odyssey through a mythical landscape of engineering challenges armed with DORA metrics as your torch.
