Software Engineer at VMware

Software Developer for 15+ years, my favorite topics are containerization (Docker and Kubernetes), building tools, Continuous Integration and, of course, core Java development.
Having recently joined VMware, I work on CNCF, Tanzu and Cloudfoundry Java buildpacks.
In my spare time, I work on various open source projects : from Mastodon bots written in NodeJS or Go, to Android apps!
