Principal Data Engineer & Ambassador of Fun

Jessica is a Principal Data Engineer on the Threat Data Services team at Elastic, where she focuses on building scalable infrastructure supporting security protections and telemetry pipelines. Her work helps enable security researchers to gather intelligence in an automated fashion. When not shoving data through pipelines, she enjoys woodworking, crafting, selecting the perfect reaction emoji and/or GIF, and hanging with her cats.
