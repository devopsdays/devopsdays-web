One of the reasons that we chose the MCC was because of their drive for sustainability.  Here is some information from the MCC on their efforts:

<i>To give you a brief overview of our efforts, we utilize solar panels on our roof that also features our green room which helps to combat the heat island effect. We collect rainwater to be used to water our landscaping and to flush our toilets and urinals. We compost food scraps and other compostable items alongside recycling. We work with local partners in the Nashville area to donate unused food that has been prepared for events, and we also work with partners to donate any unwanted items that events might have that someone might have use for to keep it out of the landfill. We also have water fountains conveniently placed around the building that can be used to fill reusable bottles.</i>

<i>In the month of April, we composted over 10,000 pounds of compostable material, we donated nearly 4,000 pounds of food and other items, we recycled over 20 tons of material resulting in a diversion rate of 27%, 64% of the water used for the building came from our green roof, and our water fountains kept 4,000 plastic water bottles out of the landfill.</i>
