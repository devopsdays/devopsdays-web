Learn the Datadog features and capabilities that are most fundamental to application developers, such as APM, synthetic API and browser testing, and RUM.

Developers use Datadog to monitor the performance and health of their applications and services. In this workshop, you will observe how an application is instrumented and configured for Application Performance Monitoring (APM). You will then query, filter, and analyze log data to understand and extract meaningful insights about the application. Finally, you will create a synthetic browser test and configure Datadog Real User Monitoring (RUM) to ensure an optimal user experience.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to use Datadog to stay ahead of application issues before they cause problems for your users.
