Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["hareesh-iyer"]

Imagine deliberately causing controlled outages to make your systems stronger! This session explores chaos engineering, a proactive approach to identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in distributed systems. I will start with introducing the concept of chaos engineering, and discuss why it is relevant and how organizations can benefit from it. We will then dive deep about techniques for injecting controlled failures into testing (and production) environments, simulating real-world disruptions, and observing system behavior under stress. Attendees will also see a practical example of implement chaos testing on AWS using AWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS).
