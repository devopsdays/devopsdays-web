Imagine this: You’re in the heart of a bustling tech team, with four dynamic web applications, each boasting thousands of UI tests spread across ten different regression suites. On top of that, you’ve got a trio of developer managers, QA managers, and a myriad of other roles, each with their own sets of demands and preferences. It’s like juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle on a tightrope, isn’t it?

Simple solution: One YAML file, variables, parametrization—boom.

But hold on a second—are you finding yourself knee-deep in YAML files, wrangling with solutions tailored for each project? Do you sometimes feel like you’re reinventing the wheel, solving the same problems over and over again for different teams? It’s exhausting, isn’t it?

Well, here’s a refreshing thought: what if there was a simpler, more elegant way to tackle these challenges? Picture this: instead of toiling away in isolation, you bring everyone together—the developers, the QA folks, the managers—and embark on a journey of collaboration and collective problem-solving.

It’s not just about finding the quickest fix or implementing what you, as the DevOps guru, think is right. No, it’s about rolling up your sleeves, fostering teamwork, and unleashing the power of collective intelligence. Sure, it might take some effort, a bit of elbow grease, but oh boy, when you crack the code and streamline those processes, it’s like unlocking a treasure trove of efficiency.

And here’s the cherry on top: once you’ve laid down the groundwork, once you’ve streamlined those workflows and harmonized those solutions, you can kick back, relax, and revel in the joy of guilt-free procrastination. That’s right—lazy solutioning isn’t just a pipe dream; it’s the sweet reward for your hard work and ingenuity.

So, dare to simplify, dare to collaborate, and dare to embrace the magic of lazy solutioning. Trust me, once you experience the sheer bliss of streamlined processes and collective genius, you’ll wonder why you ever made things so complicated in the first place.
