I am a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS, where I partner with a sales and business development team to accelerate AWS adoption through strategic and technical engagements with customers.

I strive to be a trusted advisor to customers, guiding technical/business stakeholders on cloud strategy, migration and modernization. I work with customer stakeholders to understand their business drivers, assess application portfolios and help them build scalable, resilient and cost-effective cloud-native architectures.
