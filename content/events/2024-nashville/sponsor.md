DevOpsDays Nashville is a community-led conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships.
<p>

From startups to enterprises in all industries including finance, health care, publishing and more, Nashville  is home to an amazing and vibrant tech community.  Weâ€™re proud to bring DevOpsDays back to Nashville for at Music City Center in 2023!  DevOpsDays Nashville will bring together 325+ development, operations, security, networking and management professions to discuss the culture, processes and tools to enable better organizations and innovative products.

<p>
The schedule will consist of a mixture of single-track presentations, ignite talks, and the open spaces format that DevOpsDays is known for.  Ticket prices include breakfast and lunch both days.  We will also have a number of surprises in store for attendees this year!
The most up-to-date information can always be found at http://www.dodnashville.com 


 We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
