### Conference Location 

The conference will take place at [A room with a Zoo](https://www.aroomwithazoo.com/en/)
We are bringing devopsdays back to where it all started,  In april 2009 Patrick Debois and Kris Buytaert met at a CloudCamp in Antwerp in the Antwerp Zoo.
The idea to organise a conference which happened later that year in Ghent was born.

15 years later we are going back to that same venue.
