Join Dan and Jason, two of the three DevOpsDays Global co-chairs, for a friendly refresher on how to plan and execute a successful DevOpsDays conference. Using data and feedback gathered from over a decade of global events, we’ll go over things like reverse schedules, marketing plans, and how to prepare a realistic budget. Then we’ll dive into one of the most important—and least understood—aspects of running a community conference of any type: _sponsors_. Specifically, how to find, attract, and form good relationships with these incredibly important members of our community.
