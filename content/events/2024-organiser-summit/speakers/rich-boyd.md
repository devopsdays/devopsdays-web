I'm a Technical Principal at Liatrio. My job is to help enterprise customers improve their DevOps capabilities through pairing and mentoring. I've been an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin for a decade and am also an organizer for Cloud Austin, one of the largest Meetups in town. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, tinkering with my home automation, and checking out the many wonderful breweries in town.
