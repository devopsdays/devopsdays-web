AlignmentI'm Romano Roth, Chief of DevOps and Partner at Zühlke. My journey with Zuhlke began 21 years ago. Over the years, I've evolved from an expert software engineer and software architect to a consultant. Throughout this journey, one question has always fueled my passion: How can we continuously deliver value while ensuring quality and automation?

When the DevOps movement began to gain momentum, I was naturally drawn to it. Today, I’m one of the organizers of the monthly DevOps Meetup in Zürich and president of DevOps Days Zürich, an annual conference part of the global DevOps movement. DevOps isn't just a professional interest; it's my passion. That’s why I’ve my own YouTube channel, where I've curated over 100 videos centered on DevOps, architecture, and leadership. on which topics/offerings to push on which channel on the market.
