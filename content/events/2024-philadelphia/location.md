    Example from Minneapolis 2020

    We offer wheelchair-designated spaces, chairs, and standing options (with tall tables) in the mainstage session room; a quiet room; bathrooms labeled according to the facilities they contain; professional live captioning of mainstage sessions; ingredient labeling (based on data provided when registering); and private space (upon request) for those nursing. We'd also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs upon request: {{< email_organizers >}}
