Incident Management is the process of effectively responding to outages and incidents in your service with minimal further disruption to the users of the service. In romantic stories these culminating incidents are usually more personal and misunderstanding related. As an avid reader and consumer of romantic stories and a former SRE in charge of responding to incidents, Ajuna Kyaruzi will go over what sheâ€™s learnt about how to handle (or not handle) incidents from reading romance novels. Ajuna will cover when to call an incident, how to communicate the status of the incident to interested parties, and why all incidents (romantic or otherwise) need a postmortem.
