If Terraform is the peanut butter for automating infrastructure as code, then GitHub Actions is the chocolate. Better together, you can use them to validate, plan, and apply new configurations when you check in code or merge a branch to main. In this workshop, I will walk you through what GitHub Actions is, how it integrates with Terraform, and how you can automate your deployments in the most delightful way.
