Hi!  I’m Ned and this is my bio.  I’m an IT professional with more than 20 years of experience in the field.  I’ve been a helpdesk operator, systems administrator, cloud architect, and product manager.  In my newest  incarnation I am the Founder of Ned in the Cloud LLC.  As a one-man-tech-juggernaut, I develop courses for Pluralsight, run a podcast for Packet Pushers, run a podcast for myself,  and create original content for technology vendors.

I’ve been a Microsoft MVP since 2017 and a HashiCorp Ambassador since 2020.

In my career I’ve focused on three key pillars:

    Embrace discomfort
    Plan to fail
    Be kind

On a personal note, I am father to three amazing children and married to a totally awesome lady.  In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, running, and drinking delicious fermented liquids.
