Hello! 👋🏽 

My name is Ume, and I’m a first-gen undergraduate student at the University of Maryland! I have a strong background in computer science, with major areas of focus being frontend development (ReactJS, Node, JavaScript, Angular), backend development (Java, Groovy), Mobile App Development (Swift), and teaching CS cirriculum to underrepresented individuals! I’m also experienced in C, Unix, R, assembly language, Ruby, and Python. 

I have been an active public speaker for the past year, and am looking to speak at any events that revolve around tech mentorship + tech diversity! I have spoken to over 5000 individuals worldwide, and hope to increase that number often! I've spoken on panels, at workshops, and was a speaker series co-host for Kode With Klossy this summer!
