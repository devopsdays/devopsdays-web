<hr>

DevOpsDays Philadelphia is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have
vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have
short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and
after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the
attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
    Platinum, Gold, and Silver sponsors get a full table where they can interact with those interested to come visit
    during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a
    community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good
    impression on the attendees.
<p>
    The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at devopsdays on their own terms.
