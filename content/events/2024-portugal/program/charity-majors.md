The DevOps revolution is winding down, and we’re entering the post-DevOps era. We’re at the precipice of a massive generational shift in how we build and understand our software, and engineering teams need to prepare.

In the past, telemetry focused on basic metrics: reliability, uptime, MTTR, MTTD. Observability 1.0. Companies that settle for these basic data points will struggle to keep up with modern development patterns, while hemorrhaging money.

As engineering best practices around separating deploys from releases, testing in production, and observability-driven development have gone mainstream, the metrics-driven approach to telemetry has stalled, and it’s time for a new version: Observability 2.0. Learn what this new version means for your engineers, and how to embrace this breaking change to:
- Save them from drowning in symptom-based alerting
- Help fewer people work together to build better software
- Create fast feedback loops throughout the entire organization through highly granular visibility into all their systems
