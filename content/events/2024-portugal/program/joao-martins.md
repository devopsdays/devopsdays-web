Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["joao-martins"]
+++

In fast-paced DevOps environments, the need for speed often comes with the risk of bypassing crucial security measures. This talk, featuring João Martins and Luis Fontes, will discuss how implementing ‘paved roads’—predefined pathways for safe and fast development—can guide teams towards both swift and secure operations. We will explore how these roads and smart ‘guardrails’ prevent common security pitfalls without stifling innovation. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of:

- The essence and importance of paved roads in accelerating Platform Engineering processes.
- Empowerment versus blocking in development, showcasing how self-service platforms can facilitate rather than hinder progress.
- Real-life examples of bypasses gone wrong, illustrating the necessity for and effectiveness of guardrails.
- Critical success factors for integrating these strategies into various organizational structures.

This session is designed for those looking to enhance their Platform Engineering strategies, ensuring that their drive for rapid deployment does not compromise their security posture.
