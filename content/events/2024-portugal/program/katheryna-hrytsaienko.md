Imagine how good it would be to have a magic button to set up and integrate a brand-new microservice in your ecosystem in XX minutes. Infrastructure, CI/CD, and basic code snippets all in one.

This talk aimed to familiarize you with the composable approach – closest to the “magic button” as possible.

In this session, we’ll walk you through how Terraform conjures infrastructure like magic, shared workflows streamline processes, and Maven archetypes simplify code generation.

As the cherry on top – live demo of the accelerator approach with Google cloud platfrom.
