When dealing with continuous delivery projects and DevOps, we often think about and work on the technical part of the story. More often, exactly such projects take place at many intersections, such as between Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure, and Development, but also between business needs and cool technical solutions.

This talk will examine the challenges of transitioning from traditional infrastructure to the cloud and offer some ideas to help you on your way. Furthermore, we will examine how open-source platforms can help you achieve infrastructure and application convergence with some practical examples.
