In our industry, there is pressure to deliver high quality, tested, innovative software. We focus on deadlines and metrics to ensure quality. But what of the people doing the work? Join me to learn how you can support your resources, and yourself, to deliver their best work… not just the minimum.

This talk has many calls to action for personal growth, and especially asks leadership/management to think deeply about their priorities and methods of work. This is not a “feel good” session; it is about the financial impact of engineers being burnt out, depressed, anxious, or suffering from substance use disorders. This talk will give leaders concrete ways to support IC’s, so that they can perform optimally and consistently. Also, I will share ways in which IC’s can pinpoint their needs, and advocate to have them met/accommodated by leadership.
