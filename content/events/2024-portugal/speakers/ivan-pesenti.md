Ivan is an Italian guy who loves coding and computer stuff. He lives in a small town in the north of Italy. Since 2014, he works as a software developer. He’s mainly focused on server-side programming, especially in building Web APIs and serverless applications. Two of his major concerns about software development are code security and tests. During his spare time, he loves sharing his knowledge with the community by giving talks related to computer science stuff. He also writes technical blog posts sharing his expertise and best practices. He’s also a mentor for junior developers and also for students who aim to be professional software developers in their lives. He tries to help everyone (without distinction in gender, nationality, age, and so on) with empathy and determination. He’s also a course author. One of the things he loves most by far is problem-solving. His attitude reflects on Q&A platforms, like Stack Overflow, where he tries to help others figure out their challenges. He’s a great listener. One of his mantras is: “We can learn everything from everyone.”. He’s funny and loves spending time with friends and geeks. During his activities, his primary goal is not to be toxic in the community. He always tries to help others with a smile without any distinction.
