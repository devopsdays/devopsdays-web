Hello there! My name is Nuno Ribeiro and for the better part of the last fifteen years I have worked as a Structural Civil Engineer. Feeling disgruntled with my professional life I made a career change and transitioned to the IT landscape and enrolled into a 9 month boot camp. Best decision ever During that time I fell in love with CI/CD and making sure all checks make it to Green. so I became a DevOps person.
