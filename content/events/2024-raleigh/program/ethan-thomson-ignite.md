A non-technical session about building a sense of ownership within your organization that not only drives tool/platform/best practice adoption, but also innovation and communication.

I've helped over a dozen enterprise organizations implement this "Chapter DevOps" methodology and all of them have seen improvement in developer adoption without the need for executive mandates.
