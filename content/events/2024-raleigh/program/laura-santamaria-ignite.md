Join me to delve into systems and science to find the best way to help organizations make big changes. We’ll review
-    How a handful of large and small companies have succeeded or failed at sticking the cultural change landing
-    Why we can apply the same discoveries from DevOps transformations to building SRE or platform engineering practices
-    What systems science and equilibrium states have to do with cultural shifts
-    How to minimize perturbations in the overall organizational system during a cultural shift All in 5 minutes or less!
