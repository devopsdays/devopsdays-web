Microservices architecture, or microservices, is a method of designing software in which applications are divided into several smaller, individual, and independent services or modules. While microservices offer significant advantages, they also pose unique challenges and may not be the optimal solution for every scenario.

The decision between monolithic, microservices, or a hybrid approach depends on specific circumstances and considerations. Understanding this concept is crucial for anyone involved in the design, development, deployment, or testing of any computer software system.

This session will use human relationship analogies to explain how the same principles apply to microservices architecture, making the concepts easier and more enjoyable to understand.
