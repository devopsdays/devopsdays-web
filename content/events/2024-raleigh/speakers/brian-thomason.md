Brian Thomason is a long time Linux geek whose passion for Debian GNU/Linux, and more specifically its package management system, inspired him to become a release engineer.

While the rest of the world was still installing software from physical media such as CD ROMs, Brian was intrigued by a startup named Lindows who had created an app store for their Debian-based operating system.  After finishing college, he immediately moved to San Diego to join their ranks.

More than twenty years later, Brian still considers himself a Linux geek at heart but has moved on to the sales side of the business and expanded his skill set to include cloud computing, observability, and now software security.
