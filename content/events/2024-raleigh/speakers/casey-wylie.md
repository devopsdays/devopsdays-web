I am the lead software engineer on Pepr, a project that we are looking to donate to the CNCF  around Q3 of 2024, avid Open Source maintainer and Kubernetes committer, CNCF organizer for the South Florida chapter and a person who fell in love with Raleigh and the cloud native community when I was there.
