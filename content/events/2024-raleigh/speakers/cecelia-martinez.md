Cecelia Martinez is a Lead Developer Advocate at OutSystems. She is passionate about open source devtools and has helped developers improve some of the most frustrating parts of their work â€“ including testing, debugging, mobile app deployments, and fighting with YAML. She is known for her work at companies like Ionic, Replay, and Cypress, as well as her efforts to build inclusive developer communities. She is a volunteer with Women Who Code Mobile, Chapter Head of Out in Tech Atlanta, organizer of the Atlanta JavaScript Meetup, a previous GitHub Star, and has served on the program committee for multiple tech conferences. She is an alumna of The College of Saint Rose, Lynn University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before tech, Cecelia had careers in journalism and finance, and loves using both sides of her brain to connect with people and solve problems.
