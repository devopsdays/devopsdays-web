Guiding Eyes for the Blind (GEB) is a non profit that was founded in 1954 by Donald Z. Kauth in a 19th-century farmhouse. Since then, it has graduated over 7,300 guide dog teams and placed 61 service dogs in homes with families with autistic people. All guide dogs are provided to recipients free of charge.

The North Carolina Region of GEB holds classes on Wednesday evenings, alternating locations in Cary, Raleigh and Durham.
