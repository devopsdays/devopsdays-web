Besides being a total fitness geek... I am an acknowledged innovative enterprise and operation transformation executive, successfully leading new CI/CD pipeline development. Transforming legacy cloud infrastructures into novel and robust enterprise and cloud platform solutions has been in the forefront. Additionally, I have launched best practice, operational initiatives and strategies, ensuring fruition of IT program initiatives for peak corporate growth and value. As an adept negotiator and relationship leader, I promote collaboration and issue resolution consensus. Also, I forge strong partnerships across organizations, customers, partners, and stakeholders, advancing operations and business value.
PS: I can also bench press 275lbs and I still enjoy wiring automation scripts! :)
