DevOps / Cloud / Platform Engineering Manager with a passion for finding simple solutions. I enjoy DevOps and leadership roles because I love enabling people to do their best work.

I have worked in a couple different kinds of DevOps roles, which were sometimes great, other times... less effective.

Recently, we have been taking a Platform Engineering approach and that has been extremely successful. The focus is on enabling others to focus on their unique problems by solving the shared ones. It allows developers to still own their code from the IDE through production, without needing to be a Cloud / IT / Ops expert as well.
