Founder and Chief Product Officer (CPO) of Vertigo, a brazilian IT services and consulting business that helps local and global customers in their digital transformation journey.

Passionate for technology and its positive impact since forever, I have traveled a long road from enthusiast to entrepreneur in both startup and corporate worlds. This is the reason Vertigo understands corporate IT needs and challenges, and also the reason why we are so effective on modernizing their value chain.

Today Vertigo operates on several countries and serves global customers on mission-critical projects but it is still driven by the same fundamental values: the need to use technology to improve people's lives.

André é CTIO e Fundador da Vertigo, consultoria brasileira que ajuda clientes locais e globais em suas jornadas de transformação digital.
