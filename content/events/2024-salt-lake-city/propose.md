Salt Lake City DevOps Days March 2024

Northern Utah is proud to host the sixth annual Salt Lake City DevOps Days. This event has led the conversation in the state as far as DevOps organizational practices and tooling. In 2024 the theme will be "DevOps is Dead, Evolving DevOps".

The upcoming SLC DevOps Days conference in 2024 has chosen a bold and thought-provoking theme: “DevOps is Dead, Evolving DevOps” This theme aims to challenge traditional notions and stir up discussions within the Salt Lake City DevOps community about the future of this widely adopted methodology. SLC DevOps Days, known for fostering innovation and exploring emerging trends, seeks to push the boundaries of conventional thinking by examining the current state of DevOps and its potential evolution. The theme “DevOps is Dead, Evolving DevOps” does not suggest the complete abandonment of DevOps principles and practices but instead proposes an introspective examination of its limitations, adaptability, and relevance in an ever-changing technological landscape. The conference aims to provoke critical thinking by questioning established methodologies, encouraging participants to explore alternative approaches, and challenging the status quo.

Here are the options to propose a topic at devopsdays:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A 30-minute talk</em></strong> presented during the conference, usually late morning or early afternoon.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Workshops/Labs</em></strong> usually early afternoon and run generally for 2 hours.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Simulations</em></strong> usually running for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Open Space</em></strong>: If you'd like to lead a group discussion during the attendee-suggested <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions, it is not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in person at the conference. If you'd like to demo your product or service, you should <a href="../sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and demo it at your table.
</ol>

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn't likely to have already seen.
- _no third-party submissions_: This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
