Don’t wait for load tests to complete. Use OpenTelemetry to capture database signals, run them through cutting-edge machine learning solutions, and troubleshoot your database issues automatically!

We don’t need to run the query to see how it’s going to perform. We can ask the database to tell us exactly what it’s going to do. We can capture these details with OpenTelemetry and combine them with signals from our HTTP layer, ORM library, and database driver. Finally, we can analyze these with machine learning algorithms, to automatically troubleshoot issues, identify improvements, and submit corrections.

In this talk we are going to see how to use OpenTelemetry with modern databases to reason about the performance and correctness of our applications. We are going to use expert knowledge supported by AI to fix problems automatically. All of that for free with modern tooling.

Content:
- How databases execute the queries
- What is OpenTelemetry and how it can extract signals from all layers of the application
- What issues we can identify before even deploying to the staging environment
- How to use expert knowledge and AI to provide automated insights

Learning points:
- Database execution plans
- Internals of databases
- OpenTelemetry and practical applications
- Machine learning for reasoning about the performance
