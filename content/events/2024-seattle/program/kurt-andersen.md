You can't have a "learning organization" without having learning teams (mini-orgs). This case study of a cross-team collaboration effort addressed specific process and skill gaps between several teams through a "learning team" approach.

When you have an executive breathing down your neck, looking for answers, but no one person has the necessary information to provide those answers, what do you do?

This talk uses a case study from a cross-team collaboration effort at LinkedIn. The work was intended (and succeeded) to address specific knowledge, process, and skill gaps between teams via the methodology of a _learning team_ approach.

With this specific case study as a focal point, the talk will connect sources from the wider literature about organizational learning and learning teams to highlight processes, organizational structures, and
skills that can be used to foster a healthy work environment with inclusivity and inter-team camaraderie while also achieving important business metrics and getting answers for that executive!

Participants will learn:

- principles guiding the implementation of learning teams,
- strengths and applicability for learning teams,
- how to foster a more humane and effective workplace by appreciating the importance of “work as done” above _work as imagined_.
