In the modern software development landscape, integrating DevOps principles with advanced cloud and edge computing technologies is transforming enterprise innovation and delivery. This presentation focuses on how we, at Cloud Inspire, have leveraged OpenNebula integrated with 100% open-source tools to build a fully integrated Internal Developer Platform (IDP). Our platform, known as the Cloud Factory, is designed to support multi-cloud environments, multi-platform deployments, diverse workloads, edge computing capabilities, and a self-serviceÂ portal.
