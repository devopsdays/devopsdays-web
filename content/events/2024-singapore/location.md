## Hotel Fort Canning

Hotel Fort Canning is a luxurious and award-winning conservation hotel tucked within 18 hectares of lush greenery in Fort Canning Park. Considered one of Singapore’s iconic heritage hotels, Hotel Fort Canning bears a storied past that dates back to the early 20th century, with the building itself a former British military administration site. Today, the hotel’s architecture continues to retain much of its colonial glamour, combining it with modern elements of the surrounding parklands - making Hotel Fort Canning one of Singapore's heritage hotels situated within a historical hilltop park.
