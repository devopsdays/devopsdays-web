### Ignite

I will be talking about how we can build our own APMs using OpenTelemetry. I will go through core components of an APM and draw parallels on how easy it is to implement that using OTEL.

I will go over the different metric types that OTEL supports with use cases that attendees can use a takeaways from my talk.
