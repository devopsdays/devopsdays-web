AirAsia is a Malaysian low-cost airline that operates domestic and international flights to more than 165 destinations in 25 countries. It is the largest airline in Malaysia by fleet size and destinations served. AirAsia Launched Superapp in October 2020. The mobile app for Android and Apple originally focused on flights and related services, but as the Covid-19 pandemic severely restricted international travel, it was clear that AirAsia needed to broaden its scope.

Adding services such as food delivery, taxis, and hotels to Superapp proved to be highly successful. To date, the app has been downloaded 40 million times, with 13 million monthly active users, and 15 product and service offerings.
