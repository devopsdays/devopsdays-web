Learn about the principles, methodologies, and tools that can help you build & operate your applications. Throughout demos, learn about case studies & industry best practices. Discover the importance of Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, Continuous Configuration, and Observability and Monitoring

This session is designed as a journey. We will start with real world example of building serverless APIs. Then, we will continue to implement IaC and CI/CD for multiple environments using Continous Delivery with manual approval. We will also walkthrough how you can implement feature flags by using Continous Configuration. Lastly, we will review how to implement Observability and Monitoring to understood whatâ€™s happening under the hood of the application.
