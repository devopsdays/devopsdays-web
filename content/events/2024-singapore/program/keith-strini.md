### Ignite

This session presents an innovative approach to achieving this for containerized workloads, leveraging an event-driven data mesh architecture. The pivotal aspect of this approach is its foundation on freely accessible, non-vendor controlled open-source tools. This strategy ensures that the resulting reference architecture is not only compliant with NIST guidelines but is also universally accessible, fostering widespread adoption and customization.

The session will address how to empower teams to make informed security decisions, leveraging decision-making ownership and self-organizing team dynamics. I will delve into how regular continuous improvement sessions, driven by the concept of an error budget, can be used to optimize security practices. Retrospectives will be highlighted as a tool for ensuring ongoing security improvement discussions, leading to actionable tasks for subsequent development cycles.

This session is not just a presentation of a concept; it is an open invitation to collaborate and contribute to a cybersecurity framework that is accessible, efficient, and secure. It is an opportunity for professionals across various sectors to engage in a discourse that could shape the future of cybersecurity practices, making them more inclusive and universally applicable.
