When designing Cloud Native applications, developers end up making choices that lead to vendor lock-in early on in the lifecycle of a project.

Drawing from speakers own experience of making such mistakes, this talk covers some good practises in areas such a data storage, compute, observability, application code design, authentication / authorization and infrastructure provisioning to avoid vendor lock-in without giving up on features and flexibility. It also touches upon when and how to introduce vendor specific code/tooling in a safe manner.
