### Ignite

**Preventing Cloud Security Misconfigurations and Application Vulnerabilities** through the Implementation of Policy as Code in DevSecOps. More specifically, enforcing policy-as-code helps in these important ways.

* It speeds up security testing. With automated policy enforcement, security testing can be triggered without manual intervention, and only when needed.
* It increases efficiency. By removing manual policy enforcement from the equation, policies can be updated and shared dynamically, removing unnecessary human elements that slow the process down.
* It minimizes mistakes and enables validation. With automated policies in place, errors caused by human involvement are avoided. Additionally, when policies are written in code, itâ€™s easy to run validation activities and ensure accuracy.
