How do you ensure consistency in your environments? How do you make sure the resources you deploy have the same configurations across different accounts? How can I see all of the configurations for all of my resources in one place? Infrastructure as code is the answer. Many developers start building applications from their cloud console. While great for learning, this is not a scalable method for building applications. In this session, learn how to move from the console to using infrastructure as code. You will learn how to construct applications that can be versioned and deployed repeatedly across multiple environments.
