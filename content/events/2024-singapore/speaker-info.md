Thank you for being a part of our event! This document is our attempt to get as much useful information into one place as possible.

## Event Details and Schedule

### Venue Location

[Hotel Fort Canning](https://hfcsingapore.com)

[11 Canning Walk, Singapore 178881](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mf93mbJbycDRWbqD8)

### Schedule

The event takes place on Thursday and Friday, March 21-22, 2024. The detailed schedule for the two days can be found at [program](../program). There is also a high-level schedule at the end of this document.

### Attendance

As DevOpsDays is a community event, we hope that all of our speakers make an effort to attend as much of the conference as possible. Attendees are looking forward to learningÂ  from you outside of your talk!

In the afternoon of both days, we will have Open Space sessions, which are attendee-driven participant discussions. It's great when our speakers are able to participate in these, and we VERY much appreciate it.

## A/V

**We will have a presentation computer to run your talk from, and we will provide a presentation remote for you to advance your slides.** If you wish to run your talk from your own laptop, let us know no later than March 18 via email to <singapore@devopsdays.org>, and you must check in with A/V at 7:30 AM the day of your talk. *Our preference is to use our computer to prevent any hardware-specific issues*. Ignites will be presented from a common laptop (see the section below for more Ignite talk specifics!)

The presentation computer will have Keynote, Powerpoint, PDF, or a web browser as options for presentation software; if you need something other than this, please let us know at <singapore@devopsdays.org> and we will accommodate you! If you are using the conference laptop to present, please provide your slides (and any supporting fonts/files) to <singapore@devopsdays.org> no later than **Monday, March 18**.

### Save Q&A for Open Spaces

**We do not facilitate Q&A as part of the talks.** We recommend that you encourage attendees to ask any follow-up questions either during the breaks, in Open Space sessions, or via your preferred social media channels.

### Sharing Slides

As a reminder, we don't host your slides, but we love to put links to them on the devopsdays website after the event! **Please email the link to <singapore@devopsdays.org> when you have it**, and we'll update the website (you can do this after the event, of course!)

### Captioning

We will have live captioning occurring; if you know you'll have difficult-to-parse terms, it's helpful to brief the captioner ahead of time.

### Recording

Talks will be recorded and made available on the conference website within a reasonable time after the event. We will email you when your talk is online!

## Social Media

We love it when our speakers are active on social media! The preferred hashtag for the event is #devopsdays, and the event's handle is [@devopsdayssg](https://X.com/devopsdayssg)

## Ignite Speaker Details

If you are presenting an Ignite talk, there are a few extra details that matter to you.

Your deck must be exactly 20 slides (don't worry about making them auto-advance; we will take care of that).

Ignites will not be presented from your own laptop; we will assemble them and present from the conference laptop. 

You will use a handheld microphone for your Ignites. The confidence monitor will display the current slide - you will not be able to see any speaker notes embedded in the presentation.

Please send your slides (in PDF format) to <singapore@devopsdays.org> no later than **Friday, March 15, 2023**. This will allow our Ignite coordinator time to assemble the slides and make sure everything works.

**Note: Because Ignites are presented via PDF, animated GIFs will not be, well, animated. Be advised. If you have alternative requirements for your Ignite talk, please let us know ASAP**
