"I am a softare engineer, self taught and have been hacking since the age of 11. I have been developing and maintaining software professionally for last 12 years. DevOps was an integral part of my work, be it implementing from scratch or scale and enhance existing DevOps practices depending upon the organizations I have worked with. 

These days I work in the Developer Relations team at Last9.io a cloud native monitoring product company. I have been part of the org since inception and worked extensively in Product Engineering and Platform Engineering before moving into Developer Relations.

Instrumentation and metric data pipelines interests me and the more I meet people I realised that there is a lack of awareness of OpenTelemetry among the software engineering community. I am here to shed some light and give a walk through on how easy it is to rmbrace OTEL and take charge of your Observability."
