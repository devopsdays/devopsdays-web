Harish Pillay is an electrical & computer engineer and recognised thought leader in the use, development and deployment of the Internet and technologies that support it.

That interest was sufficient enough to drive his work in his MSEE thesis which was about building a TCP/IP stack for the then Microsoft/IBM OS/2 operating system.

In 1996, together with a small group of collaborators, he ran the very first APRICOT conference. That conference has continued annually in helping educate engineers, network operators, policy makers around Asia Pacific.

Apart from interests in networking, he continues to be an educator and mentor to startups in the technology space especially with solutions that are built using open source technologies as he is of the firm belief that enabling customers and societies at large with all of the tools in an open manner brings forth significant benefits.

He continues to be actively involved with the Internet Society Singapore chapter holding various committee and leadership positions. He is a Fellow of the Singapore Computer Society, a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore.
