Ned Lowe is the CTO of MISSION+, where he helps interesting people build interesting products using offshore development teams.

Previously, he was Head of Engineering at Singlife with Aviva, where he oversaw the direction and strategy for Singlife’s application tech stack.  He was the Chief Technology Officer of Singlife prior to the Aviva Singapore merger.

Before Singlife, Ned began his career in the banking sector at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. After spending 12 years working in equity and fixed income trading technology, he was bitten by the startup bug and moved into FinTech, setting up his own SaaS firm, Argomi. Ned then joined Amazon Web Services to help financial institutions with their digital transformation strategy.

Ned has a burning passion for technology — he picked up coding at the age of 8 and had always envisioned himself being a chip designer as he studied for his Masters of Engineering at Imperial College London. When not evangelising technology to anyone who will listen, he is usually found deadlifting or running up and down mountains – not an easy endeavour where he lives in Singapore.
