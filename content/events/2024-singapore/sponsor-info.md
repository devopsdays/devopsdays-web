# <a name='#other-faqs'></a>Other FAQs

**When can we pick our booth spot?**

Booths are assigned accordingly to sponsor level, then prioritized by when payment was received.

**What is the booth set up? Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?**

Booths are long tables ( 180cm x 75cm) with a black tablecloth and power strip and 2 chairs. We recommend bringing/shipping: signage, handouts, pop-up banners, giveaways, etc. Banners must fit behind your booth.

**How many scanners (and which type) do we get?**

We do not provide scanners. This is not your typical conference. The booth is a place to interact with people during breaks.

Sponsors​ ​benefit​​ ​most​ ​when​ ​they actively​ ​participate​.

You are responsible for collecting any information in person. Raffles with a business card draw work well. Just let us know and we will give time on Day 2 to announce raffle winners. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference, attend talks, and actively participate in open space sessions with the other attendees.

**Who should staff the booth? What are expo hours?**

If your goal is recruiting, consider sending engineering managers. If you are a vendor, send your sales engineers as well as your technical product marketing, and even some engineers. DevOpsDays are about quality, not quantity - it's about active participation!

**Can we do a giveaway on stage?**

Yes. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g. business cards, entry slips, etc.) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use. After the ignites on the second day, we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.

**Who organizes DevOpsDays Singapore?**

Your [DevOpsDays Singapore organizers](https://devopsdays.org/events/2024-singapore/contact) are Singapore-based technology folks who volunteer their time for this event.
