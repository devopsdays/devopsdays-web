This year's DevOpsDays Tel Aviv (co-located with Cloud Native & OSS Tel Aviv and [Statscraft](https://statscraft.org.il), will be a two-day, TWO TRACK event - with the main stage being the DevOpsDays track, and the additional track being dedicated to either Cloud Native + OSS and Statscraft on each day.

This year's DevOpsDays Tel Aviv will have a primary theme of engineering <strong>horror stories</strong>, in the spirit of Halloween. 

To this end we would like to receive talk submissions that focus on the following categories:

- Production Impairment - Cases in which the end result was downtime or an impairment of the system, with focus on the ingredients that caused the issue and how the issue was resolved.
- Costly Mistakes - Cases in which the end result was an unexpected or extreme cloud cost, with a focus on what caused the rise in costs, and what was done in response to try and lower costs.
- Technical Debt - Cases where short/mid-term decisions were made, with focus on what were the long-term consequences on the system’s architecture and on the company’s culture.
- Near Miss - Cases where the system could have been impaired, but was saved at the last minute by the last piece of dangling dry duct tape, and what was that duct tape.

<strong>While the central theme of the conference will be Horror Stories, we know that some people have their own compelling non-spooky stories to tell too. As long as your session is related to DevOps, Cloud Native, OSS, and/or monitoring and observability, feel free to submit an interesting session on any relevant topic.</strong>



What you should think about before you submit.

Ask yourself questions like:

- Why this talk? What makes it a must see for those attending the audience?
- Is this talk related to the subjects the conference covers?
- Have I proofread the content and done a grammatical review?
- Does this content already exist online? (DevOpsDays makes an effort to bring new content to its audience).
- Does this talk focus on a specific tool? We are of the opinion that the tooling changes and implementation details evolve. Therefore, the higher order the concept of the talk, the better.  (Demos with a specific stack are welcome - however, specific tooling talks will likely be passed over, unless for an ignite session, which they are more relevant for).
- Is the topic of the talk directly related to a product or service my company offers? (Hint: If you answered yes, it probably is not the right fit.)


<strong>~/ talk language</strong>

For inclusivity purposes, as we often times have attendees from all over the globe, DevOpsDays Tel Aviv talks are expected to be delivered in English.

<strong>~/ talk formats</strong>

This year’s talk formats include:

<strong>SHORT & LONG SESSIONS.</strong> 25 or 40-Minute sessions in tracks

<strong>IGNITES.</strong> A 5-Minute fast-paced talk with (up to) 20 slides (There's the traditional ignite with auto-advancing slides, and the lighter, freestyle ignite - let us know which you are willing to do).


<strong>~/ talk level</strong>

In an effort to be able to provide attendees with a better classification of talks, we are requesting both a Track categorization and proficiency - so folks can choose sessions to attend based on their knowledge and level.


<strong>~ / suggested topics</strong>

<strong>DEVOPSDAYS TEL AVIV</strong> covers the intersection between development and operations, with a focus on the culture, core technologies, systems, protocols & principles that are the backbone of scalable, resilient, robust, and secure systems. In this year’s horror stories theme the focus would be on cases where the issues and solutions were derived from the culture, architecture & principles of DevOps.

<strong>CLOUD NATIVE DAY TEL AVIV</strong> is the mirror image of DevOpsDays Tel Aviv, where the focus is indeed on modern cloud native tool chains, open source projects that power the cloud native world, serverless, containers, networking, service mesh and more. In this year’s horror stories theme the focus would be on cases where the issues and solutions were derived from adoption of new technologies and tools.

<strong>STATSCRAFT</strong> is focused on helping engineers understand how to make monitoring easier for humans with content that dives into the tools & methods, insights on how to derive more from your data, and ensuring systems are built to empower and enable the humans behind them to have a good quality of life. In this year’s horror stories theme the focus would be on cases where monitoring masked issues, and how monitoring was used to uncover those masked issues.


<strong>~/ guidelines - The Finer Print</strong>

Like every year we are looking to include:

- Diversity: We embrace diversity and encourage proposals from people in underrepresented parts of our community
- Original content: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- New presenters: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody’s voice
- No vendor pitches: we value vendors and sponsors, but vendor promotional talks won’t be accepted.


There is an additional format at every devopsdays:
- <strong>Open Spaces</strong>: If you'd like to lead a group discussion during the attendee-suggested <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space</a> breakout sessions, it is not necessary to propose it ahead of time. Those topics are suggested in person at the conference. If you'd like to demo your product or service, you should <a href="../sponsor">sponsor the event</a> and demo it at your table.

Choosing talks is part art, part science; here are some factors we consider when trying to assemble the best possible program for our local audience:

- _broad appeal_: How will your talk play out in a room of people with a variety of backgrounds? Technical deep dives need more levels to provide value for the whole room, some of whom might not use your specific tool.
- _new local presenters_: You are the only one who can tell your story. We are very interested in the challenges and successes being experienced in our local area. We are happy to provide guidance/coaching for new speakers upon request.
- _under-represented voices_: We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as a technology field, you're in a large, traditional organization, or you're the only person at your organization with your background, we are interested in your unique experience.
- _original content_: We will consider talks that have already been presented elsewhere, but we prefer talks that the local area isn't likely to have already seen.
- _no third-party submissions_: This is a small community-driven event, and speakers need to be directly engaged with the organizers and attendees. If a PR firm or your marketing department is proposing the talk, you've already shown that as a speaker you're distant from the process.
- _no vendor pitches_: As much as we value vendors and sponsors, we are not going to accept a talk that appears to be a pitch for your product.
