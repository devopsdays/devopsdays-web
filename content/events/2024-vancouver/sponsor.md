We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<hr>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
<p>
Gold sponsors get a full table and Silver sponsors a shared table where they can interact with those interested to come visit during breaks. All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<p>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

  <h2>Sponsor FAQ</h2>
  <p><strong>Who should I send to DevOpsDays?</strong></p>
  <p>Send your technical folks that can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks. All experience levels are welcome.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the demographics of the attendees?</strong></p>
  <p>Technologists, architects, technology managers.</p>
  <p><strong>Can you send a floor plan?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes. The general floor plan can be <a href="https://robsonsquare3.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2018/12/UBC-Robson-Square-Floor-Plan.pdf">found here</a> but we will sending an event specific one out once we have it finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>How big is our table/booth space?</strong></p>
  <p>For Platinum, Gold, and Silver Sponsors, you will receive a table (usually something at least 2’ x 6’ or longer) and two chairs; Platinum and Gold sponsors will be located in the main hall area, while Silver sponsors will be in an adjoining room. We encourage sponsors to send engineers to interact with attendees during session breaks, and to avoid large displays and heavy marketing materials.</p>
  <p><strong>Can we choose our booth location?</p></strong>
  <p>Aside from the Platinum Sponsor, booths are not selectable, our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks from the conference date.</p>
  <p><strong>What does the one minute pitch (for applicable sponsors) entail?</strong>
  <p>Between sessions, Platinum and Gold Sponsors are given one minute (timed) to introduce themselves and their company to the full audience. The emcee will invite a small number to make an introduction during transitions between sessions on either day one or day two. In addition to the full audience, your one-minute pitch will be broadcast to the audience watching the live Internet video feed, which will also be posted up to the site afterwards. Please note: one minute is not sufficient time to demo.</p>
