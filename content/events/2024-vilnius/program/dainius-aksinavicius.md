How often do you hear about a shared service center entering the open market and doing it voluntarily? Dainius Aksinavičius, Head of one such company - Centric IT Solutions Lithuania, is currently at the peak of such transformation. His team, working in the Lithuanian branch, has so far had very little direct contact with the external clients – most of the services were provided only through the parent company in the Netherlands. Not wanting to waste the team potential, this year the branch is becoming one of the rare examples of a service center transformation into a commercial organization. In his talk, the expert will reveal the value of proactivity in the pursuit of stability in the unstable IT world.
