The talk is aimed at platform and software engineers, who are not necessarily experts in cryptography, but have to deal with sensitive data in the Cloud and are looking for ways to do this is a safe and privacy-preserving fashion. We hope to show how Confidential Computing (CC) can be a useful addition to their toolbelt to address this problem.

By discussing foundational concepts that are relevant for all Confidentiality - Integrity, Trust and Attestation - we'll understand what CC-capable hardware like AMD SEV or Intel TDX can do for us today and where its limitations are.
