After an amazing journey to create the AWS CDK, CDK8s, JSII and Projen, Elad has recently left the comforts of AWS to start a new company called Wing Cloud. Wing’s mission is to democratize the cloud by reimagining cloud development from the ground up (pun intended of course). Elad lives in Tel-Aviv with his husband and 4-year-old twins, and in his spare time attends Burning Man and sweats at the local CrossFit gym. Elad gave talks in previous CDK Days and in front of large audiences at multiple conferences. Elad’s talks are usually heavy on the live-coding, because that’s basically the only thing he really knows how to do.
