Kris Buytaert is a long time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He's one of instigators of the devops movement, working for Inuits.eu / o11y.eu

He started more than one conference series and lost count on how many times he spoke at other events. He spends most of his time working on bridging the gap between developers and operations , while warning people not to make the mistakes he made. He builds infrastructures that can survive the 10th floor test, or a datacenter fire, while actively promoting the devops idea !

He hasn't blogged for a while but people still point out the title of his blog. Titled "Everything is a Freaking DNS Problem" ,it can be found at http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/
