## <a name='SponsorTables'></a>Sponsor Tables

| Sponsor            | Table # | Table Rank |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| Silver Sponsors    | S1      | 10           |
| VMware Tanzu       | S2      | 3            |
| CloudBees          | S3      | 6            |
| Puppet by Perforce | S4      | 5            |

**Table allocation note**: We have assigned tables based on the order in which sponsorships were secured, and sponsorship tier (Table Rank). We have assigned LaunchDarkly and Datadog  (\#1 and \#2) to tables S5 and S6 near the entrance/exit. The other tables seem mostly equally desirable, but if you feel your table assignment is not in line with your Table Rank, let us know.

**Silver Sponsor note**: The first day we will have 1/6th table allocated for your marketing materials to accommodate registration, then 1/3rd table the second day. We regret that we don't have sufficient table space the first day.

This is a simple verbal pitch. No slides banners, or other materials. We will display your company logo on the main screen during your pitch. Most folks mention their job openings/company overview rather than a product pitch.

## <a name='OtherFAQs'></a>Other FAQs

**How many people will be attending the conference?**

We are expecting 300 - 350 people at the conference.

**What are the demographics of the attendees?**

DevOpsDays conferences typically attract software, operations, infosec, QA, and build engineers, as well as architects and technology managers. 

These folks are attending to your learn and to share learnings about the DevOps movement. They most appreciate sponsors who engage with them with that in mind.

**Will sponsors get an email list of attendees? Do we get a dedicated email blast?**

No, we will not be sending out a formalized list.

Sponsors will have their logos in all conference emails to participants. We cannot send out emails on behalf of sponsors and will not share contact information or lists of attendee names.

We are considering follow-up email to our attendees after the event. If you are interested in have a Sponsor Blurb/Update in that newsletter, please discuss with us at the event.

**When can we pick our booth spot?**

Booths are assigned accordingly to sponsor level, then prioritized by when payment was received. We try not to place competitors next to each other and try to accommodate any requests.

**What is the booth set up? Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?**

Booths are long tables ( 72" x 30") with a black tablecloth and power strip and 2 chairs. We recommend bringing/shipping: signage, handouts, pop-up banners, giveaways, etc. Banners must fit behind your booth.

<!--

*A Gold sponsor table from 2019*

**How many scanners (and which type) do we get?**

We do not provide scanners. This is not your typical conference. The booth is a place to interact with people during breaks.

Sponsors​ ​benefit​​ ​most​ ​when​ ​they actively​ ​participate​.

You are responsible for collecting any information in person. Raffles with a business card draw work well. Just let us know and we will give time on Day 2 to announce raffle winners between talks and lunch. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference, attend talks, and actively participate in open space sessions with the other attendees.

**What is the 20% off code for additional sponsorship tickets?**

You should have received custom discount codes in your welcome email. Please contact us if you have not.

**Who should staff the booth? What are expo hours?**

If your goal is recruiting, consider sending engineering managers. If you are a vendor, send your sales engineers as well as your technical product marketing, and even some engineers. DevOpsDays are about quality, not quantity - it's about active participation!

**Can we do a giveaway on stage?**

Yes. If you want to do a giveaway, you will need to collect your own information (e.g. business cards, entry slips, etc.) for whatever drawing mechanism you want to use. After the ignites on the second day, we will give you a short time slot on stage for your giveaway activity. Just let us know.

**Can I sponsor a talk?**

Absolutely not. Devopsdays does not sell conference speaking slots; sponsors' employees are welcome to submit talk proposals. You _can_, as a participant, suggest an Open space topic within your problem space. 

**Can I get a discount for sponsoring multiple DevOpsDays?**

All DevOpsDays events are independently organized, so no multi-city sponsorships are available.

**Who organizes DevOpsDays DC?**

Your [DevOpsDays DC organizers](https://devopsdays.org/washington-dc/contact) are DC-based technology folks who volunteer their time for this event.

All money collected from sponsors goes towards the conference and its related expenses. Contact us at sponsors@devopsdaysdc.org  to get our W9.

For any other questions, email all of us at <washington-dc@devopsdays.org>
