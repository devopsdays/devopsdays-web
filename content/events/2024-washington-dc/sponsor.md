DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that depends on your sponsorships. We value
sponsor/attendee interaction, so we introduce all sponsors to attendees, include sponsors in
all conference activities, and maintain a low attendee to sponsor ratio (about 18 attendees per sponsor).

<!-- We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. -->
Sponsors have recognition on the website and social media before and during the event, and the
opportunity for short elevator pitches during the program.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces, but this is a 
community-focused conference, so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to 
make a good impression on the attendees.  The best thing to do is send practitioners to interact with their peers at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

We expect over 300 attendees based on venue capacity and past participation, and they will represent the diverse nature of the DC-Maryland-Virginia economy.

DevOpsDays DC does not share registration information directly with sponsors, but feel free to ask attendees for their contact details.

* Part of the mission to help promote technology and/or technology education in DC, Maryland and Virginia
* Willing to help promote, in kind, DevOpsDays DC.
* Willing to adhere to our code of conduct

Sponsors are granted one comp ticket, a discount code to promote within their community, Twitter/Fediverse and LinkedIn mentions, and your icon on our website and slides.

Please reach out to sponsors@devopsdaysdc.org to set up this relationship.
