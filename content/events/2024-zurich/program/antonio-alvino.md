### Ignite

DevOps is more than "just" a methodology. It can, actually, help save lives.

In our Ignite talk, we will give you a view from behind the scenes on how our alert and situational awareness platform for volunteer and professional rescuers is built and constantly improved.

We are going to explain our use of mechanisms such as the public cloud, infrastructure-as-code, microservice architectures and event-driven design in a high-availability, mission-critical setting.

For each step along the way, we will give you a real-life example of how DevOps can help save lives. Not just ours, but also those of our rescuers and patients. :)
