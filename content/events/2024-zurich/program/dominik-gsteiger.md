### Talk

Explore the exciting realm of banking software development, where the need for rapid innovation meets the uncompromising demands for integrity and reliability. In this session, we will explore how the 'Move Fast and Break Things' approach, synonymous with many agile startups, can be adapted to the banking sector's unique environment, characterized by stringent requirements for integrity, consistency, performance, and availability. We'll dive into how automated testing, DevOps, and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automations emerge as key solutions in addressing these challenges.

In this context, Pascal, Dominik, and Thomas from Zürcher Kantonalbank will share their insights and experiences. As Solution Architects, Scrum Master, and DevOps Engineers, they will provide a hollistic view within the payment domain's software development in the Zürcher Kantonalbank.

Discover how these methodologies not only accelerate the development process but also enhance software quality and security. This talk is an essential opportunity to understand how agile practices can be effectively implemented in the banking industry, ensuring that speed and innovation coexist with the highest standards of security and stability.
