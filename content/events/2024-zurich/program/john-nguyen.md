### Ignite

VS Code is an incredibly powerful tool that, when used to its full potential, can revolutionize your development workflow. With its extensive library of extensions and customizable settings, you can tailor it to fit your unique needs. Don't overlook the importance of the ".vscode" folder - it's a shared resource that can streamline collaboration and boost productivity. By taking the time to configure it properly, you can take your coding game to the next level.
In this talk, I want to give an example of what a good setup can look like, show what you can put in that folder, and conclude why you should add it to your repository.
