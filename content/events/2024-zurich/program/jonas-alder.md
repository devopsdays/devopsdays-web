### Talk

When we talk about DevOps, we often imagine clear cut applications with defined team responsibilities running on the newest state-of-the-art technology. But how can we apply DevOps principles across a patchwork of applications combining standard software with custom made services? With a small but growing team, responsible for more applications on different technologies than we have engineers available? In short, where do you even start to apply DevOps in a startup with giant ambitions?

Meet Climeworks who specializes in removing CO2 from ambient air. The company was founded in 2009 as an ETH spin-off, is constantly scaling up and leads the race to net zero.

Learn about the struggles and successes of Climeworks in the journey to scaling DevOps within a constantly growing company. We share the story of how we keep up with the evolving needs of the organization, why we built our own custom-made integration layer and how we motivate people to release often by making it fun!
