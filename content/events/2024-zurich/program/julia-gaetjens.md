### Talk

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Past software supply chain attacks like Log4J and NotPetya show that this is particularly true for software supply chains.

In this talk, we’ll explore the role of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in not only minimizing security risks but also significantly improving response times in the face of evolving cyber threats. We’ll discuss what SBOMs are, why they are increasingly crucial in IT Security and how they can be integrated into DevSecOps processes.
