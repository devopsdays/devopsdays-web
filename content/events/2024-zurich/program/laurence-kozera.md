### Workshop

<strong>Room:</strong> “Seminar” / 1st floor 

<strong>Abstract:</strong>
Building on the success of last year's conference opening by former Googler and Psychological Safety consultant Laurence Kozera, and engineer-turned-leadership coach Arjanna van der Plas, this talk/workshop will explore the crucial role of fostering open conversations within the DevOps culture.

How likely are you and your colleagues to say the following things during a meeting?

"Feel free to challenge my thinking."
"Your input is valued."
"Can we explore different perspectives?"

It’s safe to say that these phrases are too rarely heard in the workplace. And yet, seemingly simple sentences like this can make or break the effectiveness of your team. Indeed, research shows that team success relies on trust, not just the manager's efforts, and High-performing teams establish peer-to-peer trust intentionally.

Building on the latest research and richly illustrated with real-life examples, Laurence and Arjanna will delve into how creating an environment where all voices are heard and valued is essential for success, emphasizing the importance of active listening as a key tool in nurturing inclusive workplaces.

Join us for a hands-on session and discover how these principles can transform your DevOps team and drive positive change!
