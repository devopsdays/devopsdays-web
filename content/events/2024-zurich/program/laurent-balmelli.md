### Talk

The business purpose of platform engineering is to increase developersâ€™ productivity with access to templated DevOps processes. Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) serve the coding stage of the DevOps pipeline with the ability to define templated environments for developers. In this presentation, I discuss how well-designed CDE templates further increase automation around necessary, code-stage integrations with DevOps tools to ensure business best-practices around productivity, security and compliance.
