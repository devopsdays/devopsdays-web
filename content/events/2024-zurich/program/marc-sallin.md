### Workshop

There is Agile and DevOps, and there is architecture. Architecture always exists, even if it is not explicitly defined. Do we need to reinvent architecture to conform with the Agile- & DevOps trend?

I'll build on a paper that analyzes the aspects of software architecture and then distill the Quality Requirements from DevOps to present how to solve them. We will figure out that we don't need to reinvent software architecture but just to apply it explicitly and correctly.
