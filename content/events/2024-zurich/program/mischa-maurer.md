### Ignite

In our presentation, we delve into how our commitment to regularly scheduled innovation sprints (InnoSprints) is a cornerstone of our workflow. We'll talk about how these sprints improve our efficiency, productivity and velocity. We'll go into how we maintain our InnoSprint schedule regardless of external pressures, ensuring that innovation remains a top priority. Furthermore, we will also showcase a specific example of an InnoSprint, detailing its execution and the resulting benefits. This session is not just about what we do; it's about illustrating the impact of InnoSprints in a dynamic DevOps environment.
