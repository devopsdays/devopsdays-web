### Ignite

As open source projects and communities grow, it becomes difficult to understand what’s going on inside. A public and up-to-date roadmap can encourage new contributors to join the project and guide the efforts of existing contributors, and also give confidence to adopters about the direction and sustainability of the projects. Is it easy to create a public roadmap? Probably. Is it easy to maintain it? Not exactly.

Oleg will share the experiences of public roadmaps in the projects he has contributed to: Jenkins, Keptn, OpenTelemetry, CDF, etc. He'll share the reasons and principles that have guided creation of *open* roadmaps, the challenges encountered, the techniques and technologies that could be used in your projects. We’ll talk about maintaining roadmaps, mistakes we made there and how we addressed them.

In particular, Oleg will describe building a roadmap with help of GitHub Projects and modern features offered by the GitHub ecosystem. That could be the easiest way for new projects and communities, and can be also useful for established projects.
