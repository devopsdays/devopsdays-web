### Ignite

"We strive to relentlessly optimize both our software and our development process. We create automated pipelines, conduct static checks, perform security scans, and run performance tests. We set up High Availability, Autoscaling, backups, health checks, and alerts. Yet, we still heavily rely on the most insecure, slowest, non-scalable, dependent, and overall faulty system - the human being. How do we communicate with it? What's the handshake? "Hi, quick call?" No, no more. It's time to put an end to it now. And you will see why and how to do it. Let's dive in and leave the "Hi" behind."
