### Ignite

In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, DevOps has emerged as a crucial approach to streamlining software development and deployment cycles. However, as we harness the power of digital technologies, it's imperative to consider the environmental impact of our operations. Green DevOps, a growing paradigm, advocates for integrating sustainability practices into DevOps methodologies to minimize the ecological footprint of IT infrastructure and practices.
