### Ignite

The goal of every cloud-native application is to scale in all dimensions. The number of customers, the number of data centers, the delivery process, the test automation but also the individual mircoservice must be scaled. In this Ignite, I talk about the challenge but also the implementation of our product "SAP Cloud ALM" product. We have onboarded more than 5000 customers within 4 years and had an exciting journey. Stay tuned!
