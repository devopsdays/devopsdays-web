### Ignite

Even though advanced ML algorithms effectively tackles data privacy concerns through decentralized device-based model training, the DevOps principles are what elevate the end-to-end infrastructure to gain significant advantages by full operationalization.

This topic highlights that integrating DevOps best practices into the development, deployment, and management of ML-based systems can contribute to the overall efficiency, reliability, and security of the solution, even when the ML algorithm itself is designed to uphold data privacy.

Key Aspects:

1. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning algorithms:
Introduce the innovative realm of ML algorithms designed to uphold data privacy. Briefly refer to the characteristics of privacy-centric models and explore how they maintain the confidentiality of raw data.

2. Integrating DevOps Principles:
Highlight the need of DevOps in enhancing the privacy and security of ML systems. DevOps principles contribute to the seamless operation and scalability of ML algorithms, when data privacy is a primary concern.

Takeaways:

1. Striking the Right Balance: We cannot deliver reliable ML-based solutions without applying DevOps principles even though the ML algorithm itself can be designed to uphold data privacy and security concerns.
2. Operational Excellence: Gain insights into implementing DevOps best practices tailored for ML systems
