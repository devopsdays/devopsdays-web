### Transforming Dev Teams
Adam's toolbox holds creative engineering solutions combined with empathy which were built over ten years of developing JS applications in teams.

Heâ€™s a big believer in teamwork and obsessed with making code & infrastructure user-friendly and efficient. As a manager, Adam leveraged his drive to reorganize teams and codebases to boost the effectiveness of the dev teams he worked with. When he's not playing with code and tech tools, he enjoys the chaos with his wife and four kiddos, who play a huge role in shaping who he is.
