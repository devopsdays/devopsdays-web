### Senior Software/DevOps Engineer @ sureVIVE AG
With over 5 years in the tech industry, I've spent the majority of my career immersed in software development and DevOps, specializing in Java and DevOps for the past 4 years.

Skills-wise, I'm armed with a broad toolkit that includes Java (Spring Boot, Spring Data), AWS (Fargate, CodeCommit/Build/Deploy, ECS, RDS, etc.), Azure (Repos, Pipelines), OpenShift, Kubernetes, Docker, REST, and Junit.

Some of my proudest career moments include helping companies secure their digital businesses during my time at Advantio.
