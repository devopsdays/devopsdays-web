### Agile Consultant @ Zühlke Engineering
Bogdan Doroslovac is Agile Consultant at Zühlke Engineering. He has a education background in mechanical engineering and prior to turning to Agile coaching he was (and to an extent still is) a passionate embedded engineer that was exposed to Defense / Armament, Automotive and Medical industry in his career. His current focus is in supporting teams and companies on their Agile Journeys and is currently an active Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) with Scrum.org and SAFe Program Consultant (SPC) with Scaled Agile in good standing.

Joking referring to himself as Geek of all Trades Bogdan enjoys everything coming with that title. Besides RPGs like D&D 3.5 and D&D 5, he is a SF buff and WH40k fluff fan. Having an extreme prejudice against idle time he likes juggling, shooting, Rubik's type twisty puzzles, escape rooms and anything requiring quick-wit, focus and manual dexterity. Latest learning path is exploration of Gestalt and Psychodrama psychotherapeutic modalities.
