### Agile E2E Test Manager @ Julius Baer
With 14 years of experience as an E2E Test Manager, I have a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software products. I am also a certified Agile SAFE specialist and took part in various projects, ensuring efficient delivery and client satisfaction.

Outside of work, I am a podcaster where I share insights and stories about expat life and personal growth. I am also a self-published writer, with a focus on inner world meditations that promote mindfulness and well-being.
