### Senior Golang Engineer
With over 13 years of experience in the computer software industry, I am a seasoned Software Engineer adept at crafting Cloud Native applications and Web applications, primarily utilizing Golang, .Net, and React (TypeScript). Throughout my professional journey, I have honed my skills in diverse programming languages such as C#, Golang, and JavaScript. My expertise extends to leveraging various tools and technologies, and I have gained exposure to multiple cloud solutions, including AWS, GCP, and DO.

I thrive on challenges and actively seek projects that push me beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to expand my knowledge and skill set. The continuous pursuit of learning new languages and development techniques is not only a personal passion but also a commitment to contributing to the success of the organizations I work with.

In the last three years, I transitioned into the role of a DevOps Engineer to deepen my understanding of the Kubernetes Administration ecosystem. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into the intricacies of managing Kubernetes, reinforcing my expertise in orchestrating containerized applications. Currently, I have returned to my role as a Senior Golang Engineer, combining my extensive software engineering background with newfound insights from the DevOps domain to deliver robust and scalable solutions.
