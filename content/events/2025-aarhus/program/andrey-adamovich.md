Internal platforms are crucial for empowering software teams, but their evolution presents strategic challenges. In this session, we’ll embark on a journey using Wardley Maps to explore the platform engineering landscape together. Rather than offering definitive answers, we’ll engage in a discussion to map out key elements, track their evolution, and uncover potential strategies. Through this collaborative process, we aim to spark new ideas and perspectives, enabling participants to better navigate the complexities of building and scaling internal platforms.
