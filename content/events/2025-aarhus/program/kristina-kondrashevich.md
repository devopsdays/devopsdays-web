We work in the IoT space at Electrolux Group, a leader in the Home Appliance industry, scaling from 10 to 300 developers with just 5 Ops engineers in four years. Promoting SRE principles proved challenging, so we shifted to Platform Engineering. In this talk, we’ll share how we built an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) integrated with our cloud and toolchains, embedding SRE principles. The IDP empowers developers to manage infrastructure and services autonomously, boosting productivity and enabling new regions to launch in a day.

We’ll explore Electrolux's shift from SRE to platform engineering, addressing scalability and self-service challenges through automation, SaaS adoption, and our IDP. Finally, we’ll share how open-sourcing this platform benefits the developer community.
