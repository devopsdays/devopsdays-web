Since DevOps was born we’ve had git, declarative pipelines, containers, serverless infrastructure, social coding and AI. Where does that leave DevOps today?

All though EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act is getting a lot of attention these days. It’s not the DORA we’re referring to. In the DevOps community and culture, we have known DORA for more than 10 years now — as something else.

Ours: DevOps Research and Assessment Institute (DORA)
Theirs: Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)
