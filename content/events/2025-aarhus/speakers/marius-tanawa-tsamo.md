Novo Nordisk, Senior Platform Engineer

I have a Master's degree in Systems Network and Security and seven years of IT experience. Although I'm very passionate about container environments, I'm even more passionate about meaningful contributions. I'm French, but even if I'm fairly new to Denmark, I have been moving from country to country since I was 13. When I'm invited somewhere, if there's cake, it's almost sure I'll attend.
