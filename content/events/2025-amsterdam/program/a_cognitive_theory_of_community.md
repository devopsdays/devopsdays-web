We can build a stronger healthier community by leveraging a little basic neuroscience. Oxytocin is the neurotransmitter of goodwill, love, and trust. Itâ€™s also the cause of a lot of toxic behaviors often encountered in unhealthy communities. Understanding the mechanisms of oxytocin in the brain can be a massive help in building welcoming, high functioning communities and help us proactively avoid toxic outcomes.
