Working as a Software, DevOps, Platform or Site Reliability Engineer nowadays means working with a lot of tools like an IDE, containers, version control and things like Infrastructure as Code. This workshop is aimed at those who are new to this world, but are curious to get their hands in the dirt!

To help you get off with a good start, this is a hands-on workshop that starts at the very beginning with just an IDE and step-by-step builds toward a real-world workflow with formatting, linting, testing etc. It will use tools such as VS Code, Git, Docker, Ansible, Bash and a bit of Python (all open source) all from a browser based lab-environment. So don't forget your laptop!
