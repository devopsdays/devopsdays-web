Containers are a **fundamental building block** of DevOps operations, yet building them efficiently and securely can be a burden: Developers often don’t know about the platforms’ security constraints, baseline configuration, and expected behavior, while DevOps folks lack domain knowledge regarding the frameworks and languages in use. The result: **insecure or bloated containers!**

In this hands-on, 90 minute workshop, we will take a look at common scenarios for containerized applications, and improve them bit by bit, taking a good look at tools available to us in the cloud-native container world.

Participants can expect to get a good understanding of **easily applicable actions to trim and secure container images**, gain **insights throughout the building process**, and learn how to **streamline the building process** from the developer machines to production.

Workshop environments for each participant will be provided, and the workshop resources will be freely **available on GitHub** for further research and experimentation.
