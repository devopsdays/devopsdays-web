Do you wonder why your developers are slow to deliver? Are you stuck in an ever-growing loop of Jira tickets? Does communication break down as you scale? If your company's org chart is more complex than your product architecture, this talk is for you.

Business and software development are governed by principles like Brook's Law, Murphy’s Law and Conway’s Law. In this talk I will show that we can break Murphy's law! Let's think outside of the box and inverse the communication patterns. Showing that Conway was right all along.

We’ll explore Conway’s Law and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to bridge the gap between tech and business—and I’ll prove that we are not the problem, the org chart is.

TL;DR; Sit back and relax and let me explain how we can use Conway's law and DDD to optimise the developer experience.
