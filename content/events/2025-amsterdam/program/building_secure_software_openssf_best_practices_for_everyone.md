Security isn’t just for security teams — it’s for everyone! But too often, security feels complicated, frustrating, and like a blocker to fast development. What if it didn’t have to be that way?

Enter OpenSSF’s Best Practices Working Group. We build clear, actionable security guides, tools like Scorecard, and free education to help everyone ship secure software without headaches. In this talk, we’ll explore practical security tips, automation-friendly tools, and developer-first resources that make security simple.

Whether you’re a developer, DevOps engineer, Data Scientist or leader, you’ll walk away with easy-to-adopt best practices and free resources to build security into your workflow, without slowing you down. 
Let’s make security work for everyone!
