Eventually as the challenges around "You build it, you run it" become clearer a platform emerges. 
But how do these chaotic transformations lead to this convergence? Whether your platform serves developers or customers the foundational concepts heavily align. In this talk we'll look at the ways platforms emerge and the key considerations necessary for one to succeed. As we go through time to understand how convergence happens we will examine carcinisation to understand how organizations unintentionally select for elements which converge towards a platform
