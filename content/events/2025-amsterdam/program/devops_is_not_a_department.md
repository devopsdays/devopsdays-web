One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s a team or department. It’s not. DevOps is a culture—one that thrives when the entire organization is on board. But getting there? That’s a whole different challenge.

In this talk, I’ll share how we broke down silos across engineering, management, and beyond to embed DevOps practices into every part of the organization. I’ll walk you through the struggles: skeptical leadership, territorial teams, and the occasional “this will never work” attitude. And I’ll share the lessons learned from building trust, fostering collaboration, and proving that DevOps works better when it’s a mindset, not a job title.
