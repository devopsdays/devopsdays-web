The biggest challenge of our generation: the Energy Transition. How does a grid operator tackle this enormous task, where all the work done in the past 100 years must be repeated in the next 8 years? Why is a DevOps mindset essential for nation-critical services?

In this talk, Willem Kuipers and Arjan Mossel from Enexis will demonstrate how the integration of DevOps culture is crucial for modern grid management. They will share insights into how digital transformation is becoming a necessity for grid operators and how DevOps practices drive innovations in grid stability. By the end of this session, you will discover how data-driven approaches are used to locate illicit cannabis farms and ensure city-grid reliability during extreme weather conditions, from freezing winter days to scorching summer afternoons.

Join us to learn how Enexis uses the DevOps culture to not only advance the energy transition but also enhance grid security and performance.
