Dutch Hacker Camp culture is deeply rooted in the ethos of openness, collaboration, and exploration. These camps are typically organized by volunteers from various hacker and maker communities in the Netherlands and attract participants from all over the world who are interested in technology, hacking, DIY culture, and digital freedom.
The most recent Dutch Hacker Camp is “MCH2022” (May Contain Hackers), which was organized by the Dutch Stichting IFCAT* in a colorful tradition of quadrennial hacker camps. The Dutch Hacker Camp is part of the larger series of international hacker camps, including the Chaos Communication Camp (Germany) and the Electromagnetic Field (UK).
These camps often feature a diverse range of activities including workshops, talks, hacking competitions, art installations, and social gatherings. Attendees can learn about topics such as computer security, hardware hacking, cryptography, privacy, and free software.
Over the years, Dutch Hacker Camps have evolved and grown in size and popularity, attracting not only hackers and tech enthusiasts but also artists, activists, educators, and others who are passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and society.
Overall, Dutch Hacker Camps play an important role in fostering a sense of community, promoting innovation and creativity, and advocating for digital rights and freedoms. They provide a unique space for people to come together, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology and imagination.
This talk will take you through the history of Dutch Hacker Camps, and prepares you for the next big one in 2025; WHY2025.
