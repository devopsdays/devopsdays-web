While cloud-native technologies have rapidly evolved over the past few years, databases often lag behind in the conversation. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to deploy and manage a production-grade PostgreSQL cluster on Kubernetes using CloudNativePGâ€”the only PostgreSQL operator in the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) ecosystem. We'll walk through how to apply DevOps principles to database operations, ensuring your data layer is just as agile, resilient, and scalable as the rest of your stack.
