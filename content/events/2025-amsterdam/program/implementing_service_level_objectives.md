Service Level Objectives (SLOs) can sometimes be seen as simple, but realistically there is much you need to know, understand, and build in order to make an SLO-based approach to reliability work for you. How do you choose a good Service Level Indicator (SLI)? What can you do to ensure your SLO target is reasonable? How do you actually use your error budget data once you have it? It is one thing to understand the basics, but actually _implementing_ SLOs takes a lot of work. Join Alex Hidalgo, author of _Implementing Service Level Objectives_ for a workshop that will help guide you if you're just getting started, or help you refine your processes if you're already on your SLO journey.
