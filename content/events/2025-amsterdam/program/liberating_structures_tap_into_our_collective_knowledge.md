Attending a conference can have many advantages. Traditionally, participants gain a lot of new ideas from the talks and benefit from the experience of the speakers. However, the greatest treasure of a conference—the collective knowledge of all participants—is often underutilized. Join me for an immersive and interactive session designed to maximize collaboration and connection among participants.

Session Highlights:

These activities are specifically tailored to tap into the group's collective intelligence and foster a more engaging and productive conference experience.

- Collective Problem-Solving: You will work alongside fellow attendees to address real challenges and questions about software development contributed by the participants. This hands-on experience will provide practical insights and solutions that you can apply in your work.
- Networking and Connections: Through interactive engagement, you will expand your network and forge new connections. These relationships, built on shared problem-solving experiences, can lead to lasting professional connections and collaborations.

Takeaways:
- Expanded Network: Meet and connect with a diverse group of professionals in your field.
