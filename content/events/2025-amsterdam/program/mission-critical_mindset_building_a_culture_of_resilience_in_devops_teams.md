## 

In mission-critical environments, technology is only part of the solution; the true differentiator is culture. A resilient DevOps team isn’t just technically skilled, they are prepared to handle pressure, adapt to change, and learn from failure. But how do you build a culture that thrives under these conditions?

In this talk, we’ll explore the core elements of a mission-critical mindset and how they shape high-performing DevOps teams. Drawing from real-world examples, we’ll discuss the importance of psychological safety, good communication, and shared ownership in creating a resilient team culture. We’ll also uncover the damage of heroism and reactive behavior, showing how proactive cultural practices can prevent burnout and build trust across the organization.

Whether you’re leading a team, working as developer or ops engineer, or collaborating across silos, this session will give you practical insights to help you foster a culture that can handle anything, without sacrificing collaboration, innovation, or team happiness.
