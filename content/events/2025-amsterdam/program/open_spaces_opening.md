Most DevOpsDays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as “open spaces”. Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they’d like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.

Open Space is the simplest meeting format that could possibly work. It is based on (un)common sense of what people do naturally in productive meetings. Principles (from [Wikipedia on Open_Space_Technology](https://talks.devopsdays.org/redirect/?url=http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology%3AqvD1AlG2x14wMh-MhSMaVuoD6VfH25l5u_3Pbe95uaI)):

While the mechanics of Open Space provide a simple means to self-organize, it is the underlying principles that make it effective both for meetings and as a guidepost for individual and collective effectiveness.

The Law of mobility — a foot of passion and a foot of responsibility — expresses the core idea of taking responsibility for what you love. In practical terms, the law says that if you’re neither contributing nor getting value where you are, use your two feet (or available form of mobility) and go somewhere where you can. It is also a reminder to stand up for your passion.

From the law flow four principles:
- Whoever comes is the right people
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- When it’s over, it’s over

The Open Space rallying cry is: **prepare to be surprised**
