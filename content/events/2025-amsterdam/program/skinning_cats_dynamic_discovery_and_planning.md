Iterative delivery has always had friction with the need to present a plan that is easy to digest by those that stand a little further from the work: stakeholders and managers. In this workshop we present a way to seamlessly integrate the dynamic process of iterative discovery with the need to present A Plan.

We guide you through the process of planning and dealing with risk, using the familiar tool of Story Mapping, extended to create a natural fit between our way of working iteratively and incrementally and presenting a plan. You will learn how to easily create the type of roadmap view of a plan that shows expected timelines while keeping different options and variations on the plan open and transparent. Since we often need to plan in difficult circumstances, we show you how to deal with deadlines, risk and technical debt in your planning.
