January 17, 2025. A day feared by most fintech organisations. The day that the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) came into force. DORA, a new EU regulation targeting the financial sector, requires organisations to step up their game in operational resilience. Goal of the act? Making sure financial institutions do their best to protect our data and (for some more importantly) our money. 

This presentation explores DORA through the lens of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles, demonstrating how SRE practices can help organisations meet DORA's requirements.

The talk will provide a 101 on Risk, an overview of DORA, it will highlight other well known acts and frameworks (e.g. ISO, NIST, PCI, etc). I'll be focusing on IT risk management and the alignment with SRE principles. It will delve into how SRE practices, such as observability, incident response, release procedures and chaos engineering, can be leveraged to fulfil requirements for risk identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery. 

The goal of this talk is to change view on risk management from red taping to reliability opportunities
