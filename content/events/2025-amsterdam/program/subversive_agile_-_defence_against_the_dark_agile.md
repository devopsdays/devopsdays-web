Sometimes, when you are helping teams really adopt DevOps or agile, it feels like you are swimming against the current. It’s not just that you need to defend against those who have a clearly different worldview, but frequently you find yourself running into people who use all the right words, but in practice undermine all the values you are about.

Let’s explore how our ways of working can sometimes leave us vulnerable to attack, and how to defend against that. How do you actually implement DevOps and agile values in practice? How can those practices be subverted? And what, sometimes subversive, means do we have to stay our true course and, maybe, conquer a little more minds and territory?

Join this workshop to share your own stories, hear our and others’ solutions, and broaden your toolkit to influence without power.
