Talos as an operating system is currently hot and happening.
During this workshop, Jorian and Erwin introduce you to the declarative way of Kubernetes clusters and how to manage them with Talos.
What is an immutable OS? How do you bootstrap Talos? How do you upgrade your Talos? That, and more questions will all be answered during this hands-on workshop.
Supporting the theory, Jorian and Erwin will be giving demos, after which the hands-on part of the workshop starts. Here, you will define your own cluster, bootstrap and upgrade this. Along the way, there's room for questions about specific use cases.
