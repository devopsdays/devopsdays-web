Title = "The sociotechnical debt of AI: breaking Conway's Third Law"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["thiago-de-faria"]
+++
Yes, the famous Conway has two other laws that we don't talk much about... and what is the link with AI and sociotechnical systems? Let's see... :-] 
This talk introduces the concept of "AI organizational debt", the hidden costs and constraints that emerge when organizations bolt AI capabilities onto existing team structures without considering the broader sociotechnical implications. 
Through a blend of academic research, practical experience, and slightly desperate humor, we'll explore how traditional enterprise architecture patterns clash with the unique demands of AI systems. You'll learn why your carefully designed team boundaries might create unexpected AI bottlenecks and how to reshape your organization to better support human and artificial intelligence. Using real-world examples, we'll examine patterns and anti-patterns in AI adoption and propose a new framework for thinking about organizational design in the age of AI.
