High-performing teams aren’t *just* about hitting targets. They’re built on trust, authentic connections, and a shared purpose that makes people feel fulfilled, valued, and empowered. Teams like Platform and SRE, or whatever you call them to embody DevOps culture, naturally drive change by breaking silos and fostering collaboration. But building and sustaining these teams is rarely easy.

In this talk, I’ll share personal stories and practical strategies to help managers and engineers build teams that thrive in both results and human connection. You’ll leave with actionable insights to:
- Identify what kind of support your team needs at certain stages.
- Build meaningful relationships with your team members beyond traditional 1:1s.
- Foster psychological safety and collaboration through team rituals.
- Use practical frameworks like career planning and skill matrices to empower growth.
