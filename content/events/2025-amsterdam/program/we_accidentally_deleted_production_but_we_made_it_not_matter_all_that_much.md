One day, a small single-person change caused an entire production environment to empty itself in mere minutes. While this wasn't great, we didn't have much of a business impact, and nobody got fired!

How does that work, and how did we get there? Due to the way we provision our systems, manage our environmental architecture and culturally look for solutions rather than playing the blame game, such mistakes haven't had the outsized impact they might have had a decade ago. This is the story about the indecent itself, and how we got to a DevOps and cultural state where we made it matter way less than it could have.
