Join us for a hands-on workshop where we’ll walk through how to deploy a full-stack development environment on the Akamai App Platform — all from just a laptop and a browser. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to cloud platforms, this session will demonstrate how App Platform simplifies application deployment and streamlines the developer experience.

We’ll explore the power of Akamai’s cloud-native platform, built for speed, scalability, and simplicity. From Git-based deployments to built-in CI/CD workflows, you'll see how easy it is to get up and running with zero infrastructure setup. By the end of the session, you'll have a fully deployed demo e-commerce environment and the confidence to leverage the Akamai App Platform in your own projects.
