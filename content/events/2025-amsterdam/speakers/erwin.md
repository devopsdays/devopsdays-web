By day Erwin is a DevOps engineer at TrueFullstaq, consulting companies on how to best implement cloud native principles on the public cloud and how to develop applications to fully embrace what new technologies can offer.
At night he turns into a chind≈çgu engineer (look it up on wikipedia, it's awesome). Tinkering with stuff like adding music to his home elevator or connecting his garage door to the internet.
His presentations always come with a dose of humor and self-deprecation. And if it all works out, you'll learn something too.
