Evelyn is the Head of Platform at enmacc, she has been in the IT world since 2006 with experience ranging from security compliance to AWS architecture and integration with her first foray into AWS occurring back in 2011 when she was the sole voice in her team against cloud. She carries a wide arsenal of skills from a variety of roles but if you ask her what she really does, it will be spending her days convincing engineers that a product mindset will make them hate their product managers less.
