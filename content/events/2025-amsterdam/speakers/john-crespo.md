ðŸ‘‹  Software engineer who wandered into solutions engineering after 10+ years of building stuff. 

These days I help dev teams figure out their tech stack and automate away the boring parts. Did some time at Auth0 (because who actually enjoys building auth?) and Harness (because deployments shouldn't make you sweat).

Still code for fun, automate everything in sight, a passion for DevOps and have strong opinions about tabs vs spaces.
