Marcel Kornegoor obtained his Master of Arts degree in Sound and Music Technology back in 2008. He has been a (huge) nerd for most of his life, but will probably deny it when confronted. Being a technology-addict for over 20 years, Marcel provides training courses, talks and writes about cloud technology, DevOps, and other IT and open source related subjects that concern him.
