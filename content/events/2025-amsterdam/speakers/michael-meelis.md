Michael is a Platform Engineer from ITQ with a strange twist of game design that merges into a more architectural approach to development.
He focuses on seeing what makes the software tick, through trial and error, and ends up with a more thorough understanding of the concept. This is the core of who he is and how he does the work that he loves.
