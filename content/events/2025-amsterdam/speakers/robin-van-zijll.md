Robin van Zijll will always be an SRE at heart: after years as an ops engineer working on ING’s Mobile app when it was launched, he joined a rotation of incident responders for all of ING’s online customer facing channels. This experience led him to become product owner of the first SRE team at ING The Netherlands where he worked on an observability stack for many engineering teams and explored cloud computing for banking. 

He now is product manager of Reliability at Mollie where he worked on the company's DORA implementation and aims to boost reliability of all services. 

In short: lots of experience on anything reliability in the financial sector. Also, a nice person to talk to about Ajax, photography, Amsterdam, vinyl, etc.
