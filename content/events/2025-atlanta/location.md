<p><strong>Out of 96 attendees surveyed from last year&rsquo;s event, 42% walked, biked, or took public transit to the event.</strong><br/>
We&rsquo;d like to see this percentage increase for our 2018 event.<br/>

<h2 id="airport">Airport</h2>
<p>There is a taxi stand outside of the baggage claim at the airport, and most taxi companies have a flat, standard rate from the airport to Midtown of $32. You could pay a little less or a little more, but please be aware of the taxi that you choose: ensure that it’s a legitimate taxi company and agree upon how the price will be determined (flat rate or meter) before putting your luggage inside. If you need help, do not hesitate to ask an airport employee; we’re known to be polite here in Georgia! Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/24/business/taxi-and-uber-fight-curb-atlanta-airport">ride-share companies like Uber</a> are not allowed to pick-up customers at the airport.</p>
