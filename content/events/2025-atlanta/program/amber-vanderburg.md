Think of the times when you have to collaborate with business units,
cross-departmental teams, and other functions. Too often, complex ideas and
jargon can impact cross-departmental communication, collaboration
effectiveness, and efficiency. In this session, I will share practical tools
you can implement to explain, communicate, and include non-technical team
members in a technical conversation. Whether you are collaborating with a
nontechnical team, presenting ideas to a business or nontechnical audience, or
troubleshooting problems where you need to communicate technical jargon - in
this session, you will learn how to quickly and effectively communicate complex
ideas through stories, data, and experiences for a more productive
conversation.
