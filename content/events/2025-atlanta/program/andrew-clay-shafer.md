Learning loops have shaped systems thinking from pre and post war manufacturing
to the adaptive feedback practices at the heart of DevOps. The
Plan–Do–Study–Act cycle, first articulated by Shewhart and refined by Deming,
offers more than a quality improvement tool—it provides the foundational
pattern for enabling both individuals and organizations to respond to change.
This talk explores PDSA for continuous improvement in socio-technical systems,
tracing contributing historical influences and the evolving impact on modern
lean, agile, and DevOps. From incident retrospectives to automated feedback in
deployment pipelines, PDSA underpins how high-performers improve. Finally,
comparing and contrasting learning from feedback cycles of humans with
machines, discover and deploy novel strategies, not to control, but to
cultivate socio-technical systems that improve themselves.
