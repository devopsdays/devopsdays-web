History depends on facts, while mythology is composed of tales which are more
difficult to verify. Lore, on the other hand, is defined by knowledge passed
from person to person by word of mouth, and varies with each telling from
different storytellers.

The charmed life of Botchagalupe is a matter of lore, given John Willis &
myself failed to keep better notes over the past decade of coffee, mexican
food, & tech conferences. Join me as we explore the man, the myth, this legend
of devOps, and the career path I've forged in the wake of this titan of
industry.
