Discover how the software supply chain influences the security of your
applicationsâ€”from development all the way to deployment. In this session, we'll
explore the concept of Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) and why they're
crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance. You'll also
learn practical ways to generate and integrate SBOMs into your existing
workflows, enabling you to maintain greater transparency, trust, and control
over your software lifecycle. By the end of this session, you'll be equipped to
proactively mitigate risks and strengthen the overall security posture of your
applications.
