Building reliable and high-performing applications that scale is critical to
preventing costly errors and meeting your service level objectives (SLOs).
Achieving this requires effective tools to test your application's performance
under real-world conditions.

K6 is an open-source, developer-friendly load testing tool designed to make
performance testing simple, powerful, and accessible.

In this session, we'll dive into the key components of K6, guide you through
creating your first performance scripts, and show you how to seamlessly
integrate K6 into your CI pipeline. Whether you're new to load testing or
looking for a better way to ensure application resilience, this talk will get
you started.
