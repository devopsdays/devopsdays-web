Title = "Building 10x Organizations using Modern Productivity Metrics"

In this talk, we'll take a detailed, granular look at the barriers to
productivity faced by developers today, and modern approaches for removing
them. 10x developers may be a myth, but 10x organizations are very real, as
proven by the influential study performed in the 1980s, 'The Coding War Games.'

Right now, here in early 2025, we seem to be experiencing YAPP (Yet Another
Productivity Philosophy), and that philosophy is converging on developer
experience. It seems that with every new method we invent for the delivery of
products, whether physical or virtual, we reinvent productivity philosophies to
go alongside them.

But which of these approaches actually work? DORA? SPACE? DevEx? What should we
invest in and create urgency behind today, so that we don't find ourselves
having the same discussion again in a decade?
