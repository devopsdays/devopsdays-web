In a world driven by accelerating technology and AI, it's easy to focus on
machine learning. But the secret to sustainable success isn't just faster
algorithms—it's human learning. True transformation happens when leaders move
beyond tools and focus on cultivating the conditions for learning and growth,
grounded in deep respect for people. In this keynote, Katie Anderson—author of
the Shingo Award-winning book Learning to Lead, Leading to Learn—introduces her
Leading to Learn® framework. Drawing on real-world examples and her global
leadership experience, including immersive time in Japan, you'll learn how
leaders create a Chain of Learning® by setting clear direction, providing
meaningful support, and committing to their own development. You'll explore
how to build a culture where people are empowered to think, learn from
mistakes, and adapt—so your organization can thrive not just in spite of
change, but because of it.
