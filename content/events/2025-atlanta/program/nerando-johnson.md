I am giving away my time and talent for free, how to I benefit from being a
part of civic hacking?

This talk will look at the benefits of being a part of the local civic hacking
community. This talk will use some concrete examples to speak about how I have
become a better developer and project manager through those experiences and was
a part of a team that donated $40,000 to charity. I will also cite experiences
and provide actionable steps learned as a developer and a community organizer,
explain how civic hacking has helped me to grow as a developer (using examples
from Marta Hackathons, AT&T C3 Hackathons, Civic Hack nights, Atl Thinks
competitions).

These steps include :
=> How to use civic hacking to grow your soft skills.
=> How to use civic hacking to grow your technical skills.
=> How to use civic hacking as a networking tool.
=> How to use civic hacking projects as a part of job hunting (both technically and behaviorally).
