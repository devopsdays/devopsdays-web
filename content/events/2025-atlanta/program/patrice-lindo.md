Type = "talk"

The tech industry loves its buzzwords—Agile! DevOps! CI/CD! AI! But let's be
honest: behind the jargon is a treasure trove of mistakes, missteps, and
"lessons learned the hard way." In this tongue-in-cheek yet thought-provoking
session, we'll take a lighthearted look at the quirks of the industry, roast
some common tech tropes, and dive into how we can actually do better.

This session isn't about throwing shade for fun (okay, maybe just a little).
It's about leveraging humor and real talk to spotlight the blind spots holding
us back and turning them into opportunities for growth. Whether it's the
over-engineered solutions nobody asked for, Agile transformations that skipped
the people part, or AI projects that forgot to ask, "What's the problem we're
solving?"—we've all been there.

Expect some laughs, a few left-handed compliments, and plenty of actionable
insights on building human-centered, tech-savvy solutions that bridge the gap
between what we say we value and what we actually deliver.
