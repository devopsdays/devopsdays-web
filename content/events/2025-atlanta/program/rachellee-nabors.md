What do acronyms like RAG and GPT really mean? What is the math behind the
"magic" of deep learning? What is a "perceptron" and why is it called a "neural
network?" This talk demystifies AI's field of machine learning for AI-curious
technical and non-technical audiences alike. The concepts, mental models, and
history needed to grok are colorfully illustrated and explained. From the
award-winning cartoonist turned engineer/keynote speaker who has taught
millions of developers via react.dev and MDN.
