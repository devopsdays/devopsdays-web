AI is revolutionizing patient care, but technology must remain human-centric to
deliver meaningful results. In this session, Samantha will explore how AI
tools, such as Azure Cognitive Services and AI Language Models, can support
healthcare professionals in delivering personalized, responsive, and empathetic
care.

From AI chatbots for patient triage to automated follow-up reminders, youâ€™ll
see how cloud-first AI solutions can enhance human connection rather than
replace it.
