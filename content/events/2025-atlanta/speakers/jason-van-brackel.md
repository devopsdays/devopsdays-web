Jason van Brackel is an Sr. Lead Technologist at Booz Allen Hamilton and the
founder (and former organizer) of Kubernetes Philly. Passionate about solving
real-world problems with software development and Kubernetes, he regularly
shares his expertise—whether he’s guiding teams at work or streaming live
coding sessions. When he’s not tinkering with cloud-native tools, you’ll find
him spending time with his kids or occasionally taking a spill off his
skateboard.
