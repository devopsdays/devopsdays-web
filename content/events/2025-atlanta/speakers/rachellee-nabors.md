Rachel-Lee Nabors spent the better part of their career on web standards and
opensource and has spearheaded developer education at FAANG and startups, on
the React Team as well as W3C. Now they work to usher in the Agentic Web,
bulding AgentQL, and teaching a new generation of builders that "it's not
magic; it's just math." You can find them drinking tea in London or shadow
boxing in Palo Alto.
