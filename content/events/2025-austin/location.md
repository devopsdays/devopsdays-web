## Transportation

TCEA is located roughly 5.5 miles from the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and about 5 miles from downtown Austin. There is public transit stops nearby as well as a limited amount of parking on site. 

### Public Transit

Our local buses are run by CapMetro: https://www.capmetro.org/ 

Bus Route 228 is the closest route. The other alternative is Bus Route 311. We recommend choosing the following bus stops, as they are the closest and do not require crossing or walking along highway feeder routes.

| Bus Stop                       | Stop Number | Distance from Venue                 | Route  | Link                                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| 5413 Oltorf/Alvin Devane       | 2275        | 0.3 mi / 7-min walk                 | 228 EB | https://maps.app.goo.gl/5zRvnkWo5wCWUbA98 |
| 5500 Oltorf (Attorney General) | 2233        | 0.3 mi / 7-min walk                 | 228 WB | https://maps.app.goo.gl/X2CQS8buiWPEQxDcA |

| 2821 Montopolis/Oltorf         | 4310        | 1.0 mi / 21-min walk (along Oltorf) | 311 EB | https://maps.app.goo.gl/fhbNEiSR3Pn2FJga7 |

### Rideshare

Uber and Lyft are the most popular services in Austin. We highly recommend using one to get to the venue rather than using a scooter rental like Lime or Bird as the venue is next to a highway.

### Parking

**If you can carpool with another attendee, please do so. Parking is limited.**

Our venue has a limited number of parking spaces. Parking is around the back of the building (please reference this map) and will be clearly marked with signage. We will also have volunteers out in the parking lot to guide you. We cannot park in other parking spaces as there are other tenants in the complex; please be aware that parking in spaces that are not within our block can result in your car being towed.

{{< asset year="2025" city="austin" name="parking map indicating spots behind the building" image="tcea_parking.png" >}}

For overflow parking, we also have a parking block at Tru by Hilton 2 miles away. We recommend that, if you need to go to the overflow parking, you carpool with others rather than trying to walk to the venue from there.

#### Accessible Parking

The venue has van-accessible and general accessible parking spots reserved. The venue is all on one floor at street level with no stairs or elevator needed to enter or exit.

## Hotels

We have a [room discount with Tru by Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/book/reservation/rooms/?ctyhocn=AUSBWRU&arrivalDate=2025-03-14&departureDate=2025-03-15&room1NumAdults=1) nearby that you are welcome to use. There are also a number of hotel chains nearby, as well as Air B&B, VRBO, and boutique hotels.

- Tiff's Treats

In addition, there will be water, soft drinks (canned), and tea as part of the beverage stations provided by our venue.

If you have a dietary need for lunches that you indicated in your ticket purchase such as kosher, halal, gluten-free, etc., there will be a specific spot to go and request your lunch. Vegan and vegetarian lunches will be provided with the rest of the lunch options. **If you did not provide the information in your ticket purchase, we cannot provide you with a dietary-specific lunch as we have to order those specifically. If you need to change your lunch, please do so ASAP by emailing us at {{< email_organizers >}}.**

## Happy Hour

Our happy hour will be at Meanwhile Brewery at 3901 Promontory Point Dr, Austin, TX 78744. There will be some parking at the venue, and we will have a chartered bus running from TCEA to Meanwhile.
