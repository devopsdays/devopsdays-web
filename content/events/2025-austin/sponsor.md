DevOpsDays Austin is now in its THIRTEENTH year, consistently one of the best attended and reviewed DevOpsDays events on the planet. Sponsor the conference and connect with leaders in the most vibrant tech community in the region. These are the people influencing decisions about security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and product development at leading companies in Central Texas and beyond.

DevOpsDays Austin 2025 will be held at the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA) from May 1-2, 2025, and will accommodate a cap of 320 attendees. Our theme this year will be “The DevOps Journey”—it’s about the journey, not the destination.
