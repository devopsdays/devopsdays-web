DevOps is more than a technology initiative; it's a change initiative - and far too often, these stall inside large organizations. Good intentions up front are lost among deadline pressure, competing priorities or simple resistance to change. How can you recapture momentum and encourage continuous improvement?

This talk will explore techniques and case studies for reigniting DevOps initiatives so that your organization can finally make the progress it needs.
