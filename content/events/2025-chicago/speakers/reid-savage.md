Reid went from consultant - migrating tens of startups into AWS while just out of college - to "DevOps Engineer", to SRE, and then Engineering Manager at Honeycomb where they find joy in the mire of ambiguity (then cutting through it). They spend their free time playing Soulslikes and projecting the pink V0 in the corner of the climbing gym.
