AI is taking our jobs! At least, that’s the fear. The truth is more nuanced and more interesting. In this talk, Bryan Finster shares his journey from dismissing AI-assisted coding as “BS” to learning the techniques needed to accellerate daily work. Along the way, he discovered what AI really does: it amplifies your engineering practices, good and bad. Attendees will leave with practical insights into how to harness AI to improve developer productivity and why, ultimately, that probably won't matter in most large organizations.
