Title = "Building an Observability Center of Excellence: From Culture to Implementation"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["kyle-shelton"]
+++

Building an effective observability practice requires more than just implementing the right tools—it demands a cultural transformation that puts operational excellence at the heart of engineering practices. This talk presents a practical framework for establishing an Observability Center of Excellence that balances technical implementation with cultural change. Drawing from real-world experiences, we’ll explore how to build cross-functional teams, establish effective champions programs, and create sustainable practices that scale. Learn how to move beyond basic monitoring to create a culture where observability is a shared responsibility and a core engineering principle.
