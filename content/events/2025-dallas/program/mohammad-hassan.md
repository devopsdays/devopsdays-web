Compliance traditionally slows development and creates bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines. Forecast shifts this paradigm by providing developers with real-time, context-aware feedback on compliance directly in their IDE and CLI. By embedding checks early in the development process, Forecast reduces failures, saves time, and fosters faster, smarter development. This talk will explore how Forecast integrates AI-assisted remediation, offers seamless developer experiences, and enables enterprise-wide compliance at scale—all while ensuring speed and efficiency in the development lifecycle. Whether you're managing cloud security or regulatory compliance, Forecast allows developers to proactively handle compliance issues—without ever leaving their workflow.
