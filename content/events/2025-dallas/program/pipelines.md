In this insightful session I will share Capital One’s journey towards a unified pipeline ecosystem, showcasing the power of DevOps in standardizing software delivery at scale. This presentation is ideal for engineers, leaders, architects, product managers, and business leaders who wish to harness DevOps to standardize their own software delivery life cycle. 

In this talk, I will discuss how Capital One: 
* Transitioned from the traditional “Somebody builds, somebody operates” approach to a modern, collaborative “You Build You Own” model. 
* Set an ambitious goal to unify software delivery tools and processes in order to accelerate their technology transformation. 
* Integrated various processes into a centralized pipeline system, creating a seamless software delivery experience. 
* Revolutionized the way they build software, fostering innovation and efficiency. 
* Empowered developers to rapidly build and deploy software while maintaining high standards of security, reliability, and quality.
