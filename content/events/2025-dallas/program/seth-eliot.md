You’ve backed up your data to a recovery location. You’ve secured your application code—and your infrastructure as code—in repositories. You’ve created runbooks detailing every step of the process. Those are all good steps, but the ultimate objective is to recover quickly and completely when disaster strikes or when you suffer a ransomware attack. Achieving such resilience to impactful events at scale, across all your cloud workloads, can feel like an impossible engineering challenge. What if you could leverage DevOps principles to streamline and standardize your disaster and ransomware recovery approaches? Learn from real architectures and practical use cases how you can apply the culture, processes, and technologies necessary to recover from disasters with less toil and greater reliability.
