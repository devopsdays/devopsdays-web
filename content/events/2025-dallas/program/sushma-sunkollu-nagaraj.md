This session is a narrative-driven walk through of how I evolved DevOps practices across diverse projects using AWS-native tools and GenAI. From manual chaos to streamlined CI/CD, I’ll unpack my journey with AWS CodeCatalyst, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and automated testing pipelines.

I’ll also share how AWS Q and Bedrock are being used to empower developers through smart assistants, intelligent change analysis, and knowledge sharing. Expect real-world challenges, demo snippets, and practical takeaways to bring back to your teams. If you’re curious about what modern DevOps looks like in an AI-enabled, cloud-native world—this talk is for you.
