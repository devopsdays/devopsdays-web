Title = "Build, Buy, or Ask the Bots? Re-pricing Software Economics in the Vibe-Coding Era"

We once chose “build” or “buy” with spreadsheets full of human-hour rates and three-year license costs. Vibe-coding and swarms of code-writing agents have flipped that script. During this talk you will:

1. Watch a cold-start demo where conversational prompts produce production-ready code, tests, docs, and infra in under five minutes. 
2. Discover why old ROI tables fail when 30-50 percent of the code now arrives by model inference, nearly instantly. 
3. Examine a new four-factor calculus: Velocity Dividend, FinOps Guardrails, Strategic Control Premium, Strategic Risk. 
4. Walk through a real estate CRM case study that cut our TCO and built significant competitive advantage through selective “ask-the-bots” decisions. 
5. Leave with a one-page scorecard, a cost-model workbook, and dreams that can be reality today. 
   
You will exit ready to defend, with numbers, when to build, when to swipe the credit card, and when to hand the keyboard to the bots.
