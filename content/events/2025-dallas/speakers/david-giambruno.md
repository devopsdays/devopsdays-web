Help companies as a CIO, CTO, CISO, and a Consultant to wield technology as a competitive advantage. My command of information systems, scale, risk & security, data, and emerging technologies has enabled delivery with precision and pace as part of management teams 

Having worked in revenue, product, and operational roles enabled me to develop an acumen that is focused while being approachable. This is displayed in my ability to communicate across communities in a way they can understand. This enabled me to be a proven business and technology enabler, making people feel safe about change. 

Delivered complex transformations across a multitude of industries, business models, and technologies successfully. Fundamentally believe that the success revolved around building great teams that love what they do, making sure they have fun doing it, and great communication. 

That same idea is shown in a drive to create a great technology experience at companies. Enabling ‘friction-less” experience for internal and external constituents is paramount to enabling everyone to be successful at their jobs. Their success and engagement is critical to the company delivering against its goals. My basic job, “Make systems work for people, rather than people working for systems”.

Measurable outcomes across my career have been demonstrated by the number of people who always want to work for me, executives that call me to help them improve their IT, and over $190 million in hard savings.
