I head Strategy at Cloud Team Realty, an AI-first brokerage that helps Texans buy, sell, lease, and invest in every kind of property from DFW to Houston. Our tools let Realtors work with large language models and win back ninety percent of their day for what really matters. I’m a licensed Realtor, not a robot, and I still write production code on weekends.

Earlier, I led the enterprise adoption of Generative AI at Best Buy, cutting new-product time-to-market by fifty-five percent and trimming ninety million dollars from run-rate spend. Before that I guided thousands of engineers at GE and GM Financial through cloud adoption & migrations, platform engineering, Big Data and DevOps.

I’m fluent in Prop-Tech, Software Engineering, FinOps, SRE, and plain English. I train rookies. I coach veterans. Every conversation ends with a takeaway you can put to work before the day is out.
