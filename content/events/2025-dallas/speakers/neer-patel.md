I am a seasoned information technologist with over 20 years of experience in software and infrastructure domains. As the VP of Cloud and API Platform Engineering for General Motors Insurance, I lead the development and delivery of innovative cloud-based solutions that enable connected, personalized, and seamless insurance experiences for our customers.

My core competencies include cloud architecture, web/application design, system design, and network design, which I have demonstrated through various projects and publications. I hold multiple certifications in Agile, scrum, and Azure, and I am proficient in several development languages and modern databases. I am also passionate about giving back to the community and supporting the Epilepsy Foundation Texas, where I have volunteered at their summer camps for over 20 years.
