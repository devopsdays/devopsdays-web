Cloud DevOps Engineer at Amazon Elastic Beanstalk SME Interviewer Mentor Team Culture Advocate
With over 10 years of experience in DevOps, cloud engineering, and infrastructure automation, Nihar Karra is a seasoned technologist who believes that great systems are built by great teams. Currently working at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Cloud Engineer, Nihar helps global enterprises architect, optimize, and automate their mission-critical applications on the AWS platform.

He has led large-scale transformations from legacy systems to modern, containerized microservices architectures using Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible , and AWS native services. His work spans industries like fintech, aviation, and e-commerce, helping teams improve reliability, reduce downtime, and scale with confidence.

Beyond CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code, Nihar is passionate about something often overlooked in tech: emotional intelligence in engineering teams . He’s led cultural transformation initiatives, coached engineers at all levels, and advocates for psychological safety, empathy, and sustainable team practices.
