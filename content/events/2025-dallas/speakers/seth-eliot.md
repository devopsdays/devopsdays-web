I collaborate directly with customers to design, implement, and troubleshoot cloud architectures, and then share that expertise at scale through workshops, presentations, and technical writing. My work has empowered teams across the globe to adopt cloud best practices and build resilient, scalable systems. Ex-Amazon. Ex-Microsoft.
