In the past 10 years I’ve gone from former body modification artist and stay at home dad to Sr Engineer at a global tech company. Learning to navigate the corporate world was a huge challenge for me and I would like to share some of the practices I believe helped me to succeed. I’m an Austin native and DevOps Days volunteer. This talk was first presented at DevOps Days Austin in 2025.
