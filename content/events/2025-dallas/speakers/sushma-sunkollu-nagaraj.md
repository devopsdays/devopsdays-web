Sushma Sunkollu Nagaraj is a Solutions Architect (6 AWS certifications) with deep experience in DevOps, AI, and cloud-native development. She’s helped global organizations design resilient infrastructure, implement cost-optimized pipelines, and modernize legacy systems using AWS and open-source tooling. Beyond the console, she’s passionate about making tech accessible—whether by mentoring non-traditional learners, leading gamified AWS JAM sessions, or enabling underrepresented voices in engineering.

When she’s not building or breaking things in the cloud, you’ll likely find her nerding out over AI workflows or organizing community events that combine technical depth with human stories. She believes that learning should be hands-on, fun, and inclusive for all—especially for those who don’t always see themselves represented in tech.

And as for One Direction? She’s a quiet fan of Zayn (because who doesn’t appreciate a good solo breakout arc).
