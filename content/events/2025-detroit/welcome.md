  <h2>DevOpsDays Detroit: Closing a Decade of Community</h2>
  
  <p>
    It is with great sadness that we share the news that DevOpsDays Detroit 2025 has been officially canceled. Alongside this difficult decision, we must also announce that the DevOpsDays Detroit non-profit organization will be formally dissolved.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This decision was not made lightly. Over the past several months, we've faced ongoing challenges in securing adequate sponsorship and financial support. As event hosting costs continue to rise exponentially, it became increasingly clear that we could not deliver the high-quality experience our community deserves without risking financial instability.
  </p>

  <p>
    After much reflection and discussion, the core organizers and stakeholders agreed that the most responsible course of action was to step away and make room for new energy or initiatives that may arise in the future. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished over the past decade and are grateful for the time, love, and effort our volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and attendees have invested in making DevOpsDays Detroit a thriving event.
  </p>

  <p>
    We want to extend our deepest gratitude to the global DevOpsDays organization, whose support and guidance helped us build a strong local chapter. Their commitment to the global DevOps community continues to inspire us.
  </p>

  <p>
    To everyone who joined us over the past ten years — whether you shared your story on stage, volunteered to work a table, ran an Open Spaces track, sponsored a lunch, or simply showed up with curiosity and kindness — thank you. You helped shape a space for learning, connection, and growth that we will always be proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there are individuals or organizations interested in taking the reins or continuing a similar mission in Detroit, please reach out to us at <strong>detroit@devopsdays.org</strong> for further discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    With heartfelt thanks,<br>
    The DevOpsDays Detroit Team
