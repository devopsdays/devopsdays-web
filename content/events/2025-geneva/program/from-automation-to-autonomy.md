In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping industries, the role of DevOps leaders—including Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), Platform Engineers, DevSecOps Engineers, and Cloud Architects—faces transformative pressure. This talk explores how AI threatens to disrupt these roles, particularly in cloud-native infrastructure, Continuous Delivery, DataOps, and AI-driven automation. While AI excels at automating operational workflows, optimizing infrastructure management, and enhancing efficiency, it lacks the human touch essential for leadership in DevOps transformations.


The presentation will focus on embedding human-centric leadership within AI-augmented DevOps workflows, ensuring that organizations retain agility, resilience, and alignment with business objectives. By leveraging frameworks such as DevOps Topologies, SRE principles, and Value Stream Mapping, DevOps leaders can create a symbiotic relationship between AI and human expertise to drive innovation and operational excellence.
