Jurassic Code: Taming the Dinosaurs of Legacy Code ??

“Life finds a way” Dr. Ian Malcolm once said.
But in our world, it’s not life—it’s legacy code that keeps finding a way to survive. Welcome to Jurassic Code.

Picture this: You’re the newest developer sent to an isolated repository where ancient code roams wild. A codebase so old, you’re convinced you might unearth fossilized comments from 2003. ?✨

Every method call is a trap, every dependency a velociraptor waiting to pounce. And just when you think it’s safe… BAM! You’ve broken production.

But don’t panic! In this thrill-filled workshop, we’ll unleash the cutting-edge power of Generative AI (GenAI) to transform these dinosaurs of code into sleek, modern systems.

What You’ll Experience:
In this hands-on, interactive workshop, we’ll explore how GenAI can be your unexpected ally:

- Taming Complexity of the Fossil Code
- Generate sequence diagrams to illuminate hidden logic and relationships.
- Translate code into clear business intent and domain understanding.
- Refactoring Made Smarter
- Witness GenAI craft Mikado graphs to guide your refactoring safari—one clean line of code at a time.
- Generate characterization tests to contain the chaos before adding new features.
- See it suggest evolutionary leaps in design, modularization, and simplicity.
- Building the Future on Yesterday’s Code
- Use the Sprout Method to safely grow new features without disturbing the delicate ecosystem.
- Split user stories like a pro—breaking them down into actionable, manageable pieces.
- We’ll also discuss the limits of these tools, because while GenAI is powerful, it’s not a silver bullet (yet).

Together, we’ll experiment, debate, and discover how to make the most of these tools in real-world scenarios.

Why Attend?

If your codebase feels like a prehistoric relic, this workshop will bring it back to life. ? If you’ve ever cursed a legacy system, you’ll laugh (and cry) as we tackle it together. ? If you want practical, real-world strategies to use GenAI in your daily work, this is your ticket to the park.

So, strap in, grab your explorer hat ?, and get ready for an epic journey.
