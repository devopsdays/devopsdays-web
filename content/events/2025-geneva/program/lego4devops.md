Rather than talking about it, what if we lived it?

Lego4DevOps is a SeriousGame for 20 people minimum, 50 people maximum. 3 organizers will set up the 5 teams (4 Dev and 1 Prod), the backlog, the ceremonies, ... We rely on a light version of SAFe for the framework.
The teams will have to build Paris in lego, install it in the right place on the integration space. They will have to manage the classic aspects of DevOps (automation, tests, responsibilities, ........)
