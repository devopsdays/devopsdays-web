Honestly, you're probably jealous of those people saying "ChatGPT" is making their lives easier. You may think that leveraging AI is this generation's adoption of the ca lculator. I'm here to say yes, you are right, but let's be honest: we have no idea how the ChatGPTs of the world are trained or if they are secure.
If you run a technology company, your data is your secret sauce; if your boss found out you were leveraging ChatGPT to do your job, would they be happy? Probably not.
In this 30-90-120-minute workshop, we will explore how LLMs work locally through hands-on activities, such as setting up some local open-source private and free LLMs to help you get closer to the promise of generative AI.

Overall, this workshop will start with some basic installation leveraging Ollama and VS Code or any of the JetBrains platforms (and you'll learn what that means and what the differences are!), then pull in AnythingLLM and/or OpenWebUI to help give you a straightforward chat-like interface to your LLM. We will provide you with the knowledge, tools, some generic prompts, and use cases to gain more confidence in your daily life by leveraging LLMs.

You'll walk out of the workshop with a working LLM that you can engage with no fees or usage, all locally and securely.
