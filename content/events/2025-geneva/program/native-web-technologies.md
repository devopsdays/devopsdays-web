Microfrontends are an architectural approach that decomposes web applications into autonomous full-stack services using browser-native technologies like custom elements and custom events, eliminating runtime framework dependencies while enabling true component independence. 

This architecture employs event-driven communication patterns and formal interface contracts to ensure robust interaction between components, each potentially backed by its own infrastructure and deployment pipeline. Through vertical integration of frontend and backend capabilities within each microfrontend, teams gain flexibility in choosing tools and technologies while maintaining system cohesion.

Additionally, this approach accelerates delivery through independent deployment cycles and simplifies legacy system modernization through gradual capability replacement. Ultimately, this talk demonstrates how to combine the advantages of distributed systems with the simplicity of native web technologies.
