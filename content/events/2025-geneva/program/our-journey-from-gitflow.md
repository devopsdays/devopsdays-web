Having worked with Gitflow for years, we have recently transitioned to a Trunk Based Development approach to accommodate the expanding needs of our product.

During this session, we'll quickly go over the differences between both branching strategies before diving into why we switched. We'll explore the steps we undertook to make the transition possible. This session will discuss how we restructured our software development lifecycle, the initiatives we set up to foster the adoption, how we used Feature Flags to achieve Continuous Deployment, and how Feature Environments and Non-Regression Tests upped our confidence in shipping to production every day. Finally, we will share the mistakes we made along the way.

By the end of the presentation, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Trunk Based Development helping you to decide whether it's appropriate for your engineering teams.
