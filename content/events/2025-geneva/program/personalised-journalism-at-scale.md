Personalized experiences are transforming how readers engage with news in today’s complex world. In this session, we’ll explore the design of personalized news systems that balance precision and scalability.

We’ll start by examining the core challenges of delivering personalisation at scale – building user profiles, leveraging real-time signals to surface relevant content, while maintaining speed and reliability.

Next, we’ll dive into the technical architecture powering our news platform. Learn how session-based recommendations, lookalike segments, and approximations enhance relevance and engagement. Discover how a robust serverless architecture enables real-time, low-latency delivery of personalized content at scale, driving higher user engagement and loyalty.

Attendees will gain insights into the trade-offs, challenges, and best practices of building a modern, data-driven news platform – and strategies for balancing personalization, precision, and scalability in news delivery.
