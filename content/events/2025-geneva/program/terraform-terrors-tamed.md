Infrastructure as Code (IaC) promises efficiency, but when Terraform scripts go unchecked, they can lead to chaos. Misconfigurations, overprovisioning, and security vulnerabilities slip through the cracks, leaving organizations vulnerable to cost overruns and breaches. What if there was a way to transform Terraform into a governance ally, ensuring every change meets your organization’s unique policies before hitting production?

In this talk, we unveil a seamless GitLab-based workflow where Ops teams submit Terraform scripts to a Git repository, triggering an automated pipeline supercharged by KCL (Kubernetes Configuration Language). This system goes beyond mere syntax validation: it scrutinizes scripts for security compliance, least-privilege policies, and organizational resource limitations. By encoding your company’s tailored needs into KCL rules, every change is rigorously evaluated. Only the right stakeholders are looped in for approvals, ensuring streamlined yet thorough governance.

We’ll explore how this pipeline integrates with GitOps to automatically apply approved configurations, eliminating manual errors while maintaining complete traceability. We will also learn how the system provides robust monitoring to detect anomalies, ensures secure provisioning to protect sensitive data, and offers intuitive administration to keep everyone aligned.

Whether you’re grappling with Terraform sprawl or seeking to instill confidence in your IaC practices, this session will leave you equipped to tame the chaos and turn your pipelines into a fortress of reliability and security. Don’t just terraform the cloud—terraform the right way!
