DevOpsDays Geneva 2025 call for papers is open for the 6th edition!

We are pleased to announce the opening of the CFP submission for the DevOpsDays 2025     conference.

{{< cfp_dates >}}
<br>

We cordially remind you that CFP's should not have any commercial aspect.


As actors of the IT evolution you are part of the central pillar of the organisation of our society. This year we would like to highlight talks that make the link between tech and the colossal societal impact: human, ecological, financial and technological.

We welcome your experiences and feedback particularly on GreenOps optimisation ideas, impact, ways to monitor advances and synergy of actions.


<strong>We’re looking for quality over quantity!</strong>

We are open to all talks but having a societal dimension will be a plus.

We will review CFPs as they come in, but please do not expect a reply before the closing date.

We strive to create a program that balances the cultural and technical aspects of DevOps.

We will not reject submissions solely based on the fact they come from a vendor, but we will not accept vendor pitches.

While you can submit more than one proposal, please limit yourself. We want to hear the talk you are most passionate about.

<strong>So when ready fill the CFP <a href='https://i14b.com/u/dodge25cfp' target='_blank'>Here</a></strong>
