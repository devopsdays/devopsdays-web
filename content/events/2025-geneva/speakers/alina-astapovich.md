I am a DevOps Engineer with a strong background in IoT development. Holding a master's degree in Neurotechnologies and Software Engineering, I specialize in designing and architecting backend platforms and microservices. My expertise extends to building scalable and robust solutions, and with a Solutions Architect certification, I leverage cloud technologies to optimize system performance and reliability.

In our team, we focus on automation and innovation, continuously exploring new ways to improve efficiency and streamline operations. I am passionate about sharing these ideas and concepts with others, regularly speaking at industry events and conferences to contribute to the broader tech community.
