From Avignon in the south of France, i've always been passionated by IT in general : new technologies, new systems and open-source. During my education, i've first studied Networks and Telecoms at the BÃ©zier's UIT during 2 years and then i joined an Engineering school called 'Ecole des Mines d'Ales'. I specialized myself into Systems and Networks by working at the Montpellier's Rectorship as a system engineer apprentice in parrallel of my studies.
