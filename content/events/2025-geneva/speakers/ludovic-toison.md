Passionate about computers from the very beginning, Ludovic programmed his first website when he was a kid and never stopped coding since. After having implemented distributed systems in Java, he became interested in deploying and operating these systems in production with a particular emphasis on observability. Ludovic has been working for several years as a Technical Architect to support organizations in adopting Cloud Native technologies such as Mesos/Marathon, Kubernetes, OpenFaas, and Istio. He is now leading an organization of 200+ engineers as CTO and is driven to build a high-performing and collaborative engineering culture allowing teams and individuals to grow.
