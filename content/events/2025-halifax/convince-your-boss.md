Subject: Request to Attend DevOpsDays Halifax 2025

Dear {BossName},

I'd like to attend DevOpsDays Halifax 2025, taking place August 26–27, 2025 at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After reviewing several industry events, I believe this is one of the most relevant conferences for bringing together engineers, operations professionals, architects, and technology leaders to share real-world experiences, explore innovations, and discuss the evolving landscape of DevOps and software delivery.

DevOpsDays is a global series of community-led events, and Halifax's edition brings a unique focus on tech, community, and Atlantic Canada. It attracts professionals from across the region and beyond, making it an excellent place to network, learn, and exchange ideas in a collaborative setting.

Here's why I believe attending will directly benefit our company:

- Practical Learning: The event offers a mix of keynote talks, technical sessions, lightning talks, and open space discussions. These sessions provide actionable insights on continuous delivery, cloud infrastructure, automation, observability, incident response, and culture — topics directly relevant to our work.
- Networking Opportunities: The collaborative format, especially the open spaces, will allow me to engage directly with peers and thought leaders to explore solutions to the challenges we face and identify potential partnerships.
- Regional Focus with Global Perspective: As the only DevOpsDays event in Atlantic Canada, it brings local context while featuring speakers and participants from across North America.
- Vendor-Neutral Knowledge: Because DevOpsDays is community-driven, the content is focused on practical experience and open-source tools rather than sales pitches.

With {PLACEHOLDER VOUCHER}, I can get a ticket for {PLACEHOLDER AMOUNT}. This ticket also includes access to the pre‑conference workshop on Google Cloud and AI on August 25, providing additional hands-on learning from industry experts at no extra cost.

I am happy to prepare a post-conference report summarizing the key learnings, including tools, techniques, and cultural practices we can adapt to improve our workflows.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
{Your Name}
