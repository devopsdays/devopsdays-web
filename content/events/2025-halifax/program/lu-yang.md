Enterprises and governments around the world are racing to adopt AI, cloud computing, and digital-first strategies to improve service delivery, operational efficiency, and application innovation. But despite heavy investments, many digital transformation initiatives fall short of expectationsâ€”not due to lack of ambition, but because of persistent gaps that are often overlooked.

In this keynote, I will dive into the critical gaps that challenge digital transformation efforts in both the public and private sectors. These gaps span organizational silos, fragmented cloud adoption, under-utilized data assets, security blind spots, rushed AI adoption, and the lack of strategic alignment between IT teams and executive leadership.

Through case studies from enterprise modernization projects, I will highlight what successful transformation looks like when governance, innovation, and agility are prioritized together. I will also address the importance of digital talent development, architecture standardization, and platform interoperability to ensure long-term resilience.
