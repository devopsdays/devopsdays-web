In this ignite talk I will find humor in the day to day frustrations of what it means to be a "DevOps person"

"The pipeline failed so I commented out the tests". "The infrastructure team is blocking my feature from being deployed". Have you heard these quotes before? Do they make you angry? Why does this keep happening? Far too often application development teams have no concept of how their code is built, delivered, deployed or even tested, and they don't care. Each slide is a caption and meme that hits close to home and finds humor in the challenges faced and the joy when we overcome them.
