Containerization know-how is undoubtedly one of the most important skills for anyone in a software engineering role. In my 10+ years of internal and external consulting, I've taught and coached engineers of all flavors (software, quality, site reliability, product, and more) on how to use containerization to build, test, and run code in modern cloud-native environments. To use containerization effectively, you need to understand how to run products like Docker and also how they work both on your machine and in the cloud.

In this talk, we'll introduce an easy mental model for understanding how containerization works at a conceptual and technical level, demonstrate why and how it is an important strategy to apply to your software development lifecycle, and show examples of how containerization is being used on engineering computers, cloud providers, edge devices, and more. Whether you are starting your containerization journey or have a team you want to shift into modern cloud-native software development, this talk will provide you with the talking points and materials you need to push and pull your way through!
