Since the inception of the term DevOps, Chef has been at the forefront of configuration management and automation. Over the past 15+ years, the Chef product line has continuously evolved, adapting to the changing landscape of infrastructure as code, cloud-native architectures, and modern DevOps practices. In this 30-minute session, we’ll explore how Chef has transitioned from its early days as a pioneer in infrastructure automation to its current role within the Chef 360 ecosystem, supporting hybrid cloud environments and Kubernetes-native deployments.

We will touch on the strategic decisions behind major product evolutions, including the shift to Habitat-based builds, the introduction of Agentless modes, and the deeper integration with cloud marketplaces. You’ll also learn how Chef continues to innovate while maintaining its core values of infrastructure consistency, compliance, and automation. Join us to understand the journey of Chef and its ongoing relevance in modern DevOps solutions.
