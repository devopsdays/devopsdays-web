With the emerging AI space, for enterprises, you need to know many terms and concepts before venturing into it. In this session, we will start with the foundational terms and experiences you must have to find the positives to leverage WatsonX to win in business. We will also demo some straightforward but valuable examples to help anchor your understanding. Our goal for this talk is for you to walk out of the room with the language (funny, eh?) and understand the typical workflow to start finding places to leverage WatsonX in your enterprise. The first step on this journey is to know the ecosystem and tooling; from there, you can find things to fit your business and get you on the road to success.
