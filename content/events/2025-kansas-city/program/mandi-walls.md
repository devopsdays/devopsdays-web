Recognizing, troubleshooting, and remediating incidents on the services your team owns and runs is hard enough; when the incident is actually happening to an upstream vendor, what can you do? Large outages might get attention from mainstream media, or at least be well-recognized among other technology teams. Those large incidents can have catastrophic results for your organization. Smaller or more obscure might just be a temporary annoyance.

How your team handles vendor outages is more and more important as many teams become more dependent on SaaS and cloud providers for most of their tool chain as well as their production environments. This session will discuss how to plan for vendor incidents, what to have on hand, and provide some suggestions for how your team can cope when someone else is having a very bad day.
