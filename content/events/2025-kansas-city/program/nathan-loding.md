Microservices, Kubernetes, and Geographically distributed applications ... OH MY! A recent (2022) poll by Kong placed the average number of microservices for a single enterprise at 184! Modern architecture patterns are great at optimizing resource usage, but what happens when you need to make a critical change to one process that spans multiple shared services?

Complex business processes can be difficult to manage and automate. How do you quickly implement changes while maintaining uptime? How do you introduce a new service to an existing process? In this talk, we will discuss how to use Business Process Modeling (BPM) to orchestrate and execute complex business processes in your application. Don't let the name fool you: this not your father's Visio diagram. Everyone should leave this talk with a new approach to solving their orchestration complexities!
