Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the backbone of modern secure communications, powering everything from HTTPS to mutual TLS. Yet, for many engineers, certificates and cryptographic protocols remain a "black box." This session unpacks PKI, X.509, and algorithms like RSA, ECDSA, and AES, offering a comprehensive guide to their inner workings, and best practices.
