Born and raised in the ever-expanding Greater Houston Area, Garo has been messing with software for at least 29 years, writing it for money for about 20 years, and loving every clock cycle of it. He has worked as *the* Software Whisperer for Baker Hughes, leading software teams, conducting design reviews, and coaching people on how to put the 0's and 1's in a close enough order to make things work. Later, he was a Principal Consultant at Headspring, making silky smooth software and spreading mirth and merriment. Currently, he is a Senior Software Whisperer (and Senior Manager) at Accenture, learning and doing software at a global scale.
