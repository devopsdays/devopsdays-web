JJ works as a Developer Advocate representing IBM worldwide. He mainly focuses on open-source AI and OpenShift, trying to help companies and users successfully onboard to the Cloud-Native ecosystem. He’s also known in the DevOps tooling ecosystem and generalized Linux communities. If he isn’t building automation to streamline his work, he’s building the groundwork to do just that.

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. A father and husband, trying to learn to balance his natural nerdiness with family life. He enjoys a good strong dark ale, hoppy IPA, some team-building Artemis, and epic Gloomhaven campaigning.

He has recently dove headfirst into Fedora since IBM bought Redhat, but still secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere. He’s always trying to become a better web technology developer, though he normally just uses bash to get the job done.
