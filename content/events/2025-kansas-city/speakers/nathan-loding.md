I'm a nerd, and proud of it! I love solving problems and technology is the best way to do that. I work professionally as a Developer Advocate for Camunda. On the side I'm a husband, father, collector of hobbies, gardener, and outdoorsman (hiking, camping, canoeing/kayaking). I enjoy working analog, with my hands, whenever possible. I hate chores and cleaning up after myself.
