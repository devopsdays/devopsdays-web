    <p>Since 2022, DevOpsDays Ukraine has been carrying the vital call to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine">#StandWithUkraine</a>. We send the entire profit to charity and encourage domestic and global organizations to support Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Altogether, we helped the following funds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CF <a href="https://www.insight-ukraine.org/uk/">Insight</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://www.kolo-fund.org/">Kolo</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://www.razomforukraine.org/">Razom</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://happypaw.ua/">Happy paw</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://voices.org.ua/en/">Voices of children</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://monstrov.org/">Monster Corporation</a></li>
      <li>CF <a href="https://uaresponders.org/">UAResponders</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In total, we have <strong>donated over 112 100 EUR to support Ukraine</strong>, raised with the help of DevOpsDays Ukraine friends &mdash; DevOpsDays teams from all over the world, global vendors, and international companies.</p>
    <p>This year, the same as the previous one, we provide donations to the Humanitarian fund <a href="https://uaresponders.org/">UA Responders</a>, which constantly works on rescuing people in emergencies, giving them medical assistance, and supplying them with deficient tactical medical goods.</p>
    <p>In 2023 with the help of fundraising, FC UA Responders was able to purchase five batteries which helped a Kyiv school to handle long-term blackouts without interrupting the educational process. Since then, pupils can continue studying from shelters during air raid danger, as batteries don&rsquo;t require petrol and help with the lack of electricity.</p>

    <p>During DevOpsDays Ukraine 2014, along with our charity partner <a href="https://uaresponders.org/">UA Responders</a> we set out to raise funds for a surgical aspirator.</p>
    <p>We raised over 1800 euros which is nearly double our initial target!<br>
With these funds, UA Responders has purchased and delivered a pleural aspiration to Dnipro State Medical University. The device aids in recovery after injuries to the thoracic cavity and lungs, and makes a significant difference in patient care, improving surgical outcomes and potentially saving lives.</p>
