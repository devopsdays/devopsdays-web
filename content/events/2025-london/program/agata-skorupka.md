Title = "Postmortems Without Blame: Running Real, Transformative Incident Reviews"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["agata-skorupka"]
+++

Incidents happen - but the way we respond to them can either build stronger teams or sow fear and silence.

This talk dives into real-world techniques for running postmortems that actually drive learning and change, rather than just filling out templates. Iâ€™ll cover why traditional root cause analysis often fails, how to make psychological safety real (not just a poster on the wall), and practical formats for incident reviews that are collaborative, human-centered, and actionable.

If you've ever left a postmortem thinking "this fixes nothing," this session will help you build a better way.
