At Devops Days London 2023, I asked for advice and strategies for navigating when your employer is acquired. Well, 2 years on, I have a lot of learnings to share. As the Staff SRE I had front row seats to this acquisition journey. I want to share with you how to take advantage of change, the technical and cultural challenges of migrating systems and organisations, and how to communicate and stay influential even when you don't control the decisions. You'll walk away with actionable advice for if your organisation gets acquired.
