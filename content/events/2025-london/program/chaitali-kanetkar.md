Your metrics dashboard is green — but users are fuming on Twitter. Sound familiar? In this talk, I'll explore the hidden gaps between what we monitor and what actually matters. From misleading averages to alerting blind spots, I'll show how dashboards can give a false sense of confidence. Real-world examples, facepalm moments, and practical tips included — because it's time to stop trusting pretty graphs and start asking better questions.
