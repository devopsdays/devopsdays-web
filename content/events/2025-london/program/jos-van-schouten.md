CI/CD is sold as automation magic, just hook up your pipeline and watch your problems disappear! Except... they don’t. Because what really keeps DevOps moving isn’t code, it’s communication. I’ll argue that the real CI/CD is Communication and Iteration. The human stuff we pretend is soft skills but actually determines if your deploy goes smoothly or takes something down unexpectedly. In this 5-minute ignite, we’ll race through how culture, not config files, makes or breaks your pipeline.
