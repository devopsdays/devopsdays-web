Title = "Code is Never Neutral: Why All Software is Political"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["kestral-gaian"]

Every line of code we write shapes the society we live in. Software has been woven into our everyday lives, influencing access, inclusion, and representation. As technology professionals, our choices carry ethical and political weight, impacting real people across all identities and backgrounds.

In this talk, I'll invite developers and DevOps professionals to recognise and embrace the ethical responsibilities inherent in our work. I'll share personal experiences from leading diverse technology teams, highlighting why ethical thinking matters deeply in tech. We'll explore practical ways to build software that genuinely respects and benefits everyone, and how we can all work to  embed ethical considerations into our daily work. Let's build a more thoughtful, more inclusive world, one line of code at a time.
