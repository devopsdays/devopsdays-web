This session tells the story of a small application that was sent out to be operated in the cloud. In the process, it encounters many unknown technologies that entice it with full-bodied promises. Will it be able to pay the price for these almost unlimited possibilities? The speaker tells a humorous story of how the small application fared in the cloud, what it experienced and who it encountered. Of course, the listener is not deprived of the solutions that ultimately led to a happy ending. As is typical of the genre, the story contains many best practices that can help the listener in real life. The session is aimed at all listeners who are interested in software architecture for the cloud and want to avoid mistakes that others have already made.
