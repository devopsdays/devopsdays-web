Scaling up is a topic that everyone enjoys discussing, larger clusters, more nodes, and more pods. However, what occurs if the load is reduced? Although it is rarely discussed, downscaling is where cost control, efficiency, and dependability subtly succeed or fail. The audience will learn what happens when downscaling is neglected in this lightning talk, including unexpected bills, interrupted services, and stranded workloads. Examples from the real world will demonstrate how insufficient readiness probes, misaligned limitations, and ignored HPA setups can lead to greater problems with shrinking than with growing. In order to help teams not only withstand traffic spikes but also confidently ride the dip, the presentation will provide a straightforward checklist for downscaling, saving money, and downscale gracefully.
