In this talk I'll break down the winding road that got us to a place of so many titles and share experiences, my own and others, on the pro's and con's of so many roles.  We'll also step back and look at other industries to seek for some parallels we might draw upon.  Finally I'll attempt to provide a working solution to the problem.  My hope is for this talk to be interactive and engaging for the entire audience.
