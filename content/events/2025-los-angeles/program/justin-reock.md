Platform engineering has emerged as a critical function that serves as the backbone for engineering teams, providing the tools and capabilities necessary to accelerate delivery. But to truly maximize their impact, platform engineers should embrace a product management mindset. When thinking like product managers, platform engineers better understand their internal customers' needs, prioritize features, and deliver a seamless developer experience that can 10x an engineering team's productivity. 

In this 15-minute session, Ganesh Datta, CTO and co-founder of Cortex.io, and one of Forbes 30 under 30, will demonstrate that platform engineers are, in fact, product managers for their internal developer customers. By treating the platform as an internally delivered product, and holding it to the same standard and rollout as any product, teams significantly accelerate the successful adoption of Internal Developer Platforms and Portals. 

Join us to discover how adopting this mindset can transform your platform engineering efforts into a high-impact, developer-centric initiative that empowers your teams and drives organizational success.
