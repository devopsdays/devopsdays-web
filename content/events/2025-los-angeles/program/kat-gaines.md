When launching new products or dealing with an outage, customer-facing teams see terms thrown around internally that customers might not identify with immediately. Good communication practices, including good translation of engineering terminology to customer-friendly communication, can save time and increase customer satisfaction when moments matter. Your customer facing teams' unique ability to understand both what is happening internally as well as what customers need to hear positions this team as the experts to steer communications during major incidents.

Come to this talk to learn how to partner with your customer-facing teams during major incidents and build both internal and external trust along the way.
