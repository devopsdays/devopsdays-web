Platform Engineering and DevOps leaders must move beyond traditional technical and productivity metrics to ensure lasting success. Developer Experience (DevEx) is no longer a luxuryâ€”it's a critical business factor that directly influences developer retention, minimizes bottlenecks, speeds up time to market, and leads to superior business outcomes, including higher revenue.

Additionally, attendees will learn how to effectively communicate the value of DevEx in business value to gain internal buy-in from leadership and stakeholders, even those without a technical background.
