"This talk explores how we helped one of the UKâ€™s largest charities, Prostate Cancer UK, rebuild their public-facing website using modern cloud-native tools and practices.We used the rebuild as a chance to rethink their hosting architecture, moving from traditional web app hosting to a container-based setup using Azure Container Apps. This allowed us to align their infrastructure with their goals around performance, cost efficiency and sustainability.By adopting scale-to-zero containers, we delivered:An average 85% reduction in hosting costs and carbon emissionsFaster, cleaner deployments using GitHub Actions with zero downtimeA platform that is cheaper, greener and ready for the future, without compromising on developer experienceThis is a practical, behind-the-scenes look at the decisions, trade-offs and real-world impact of using scalable, container-native infrastructure to power a major public website.Whether you're modernising legacy systems, exploring containerisation or looking to make your web estate faster, leaner and more sustainable, this session shows what is possible when you bring smart engineering and real-world constraints together."
