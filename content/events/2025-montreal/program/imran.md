Title = "Scaling Self-Hosted Compute: A lesson in Platform Engineering across an enterprise"
Type = "talk"
Speakers = ["imran"]
+++

The session will cover a 1.5 year journey to finally create the one platform to rule them all! - powered by GitHub and GitHub Actions. The main lessons learned will cover onboarding and compute. How do we scale our self-hosted compute to be as extensible as possible across an org with demands for high-spec'd compute for AI workloads? Enter ARC (actions-runner-controller), GitHub's solution that orchestrates and scales self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions. I will walk everyone through the journey on self-hosting compute at an enterprise level with lessons learned in caching, label definitions, and small tidbits from hosting VMs instead of K8 clusters.
