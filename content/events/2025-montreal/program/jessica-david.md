Have you ever been stuck on a problem for days, only to have someone tell you to “just” do something to fix it? As if the solution was _so_ obvious that you should be able to figure it out without asking someone for help? This talk will discuss the word “just” and other words that imply simplicity in places it may not exist, but more importantly how it impacts us as developers and engineers, both through the lens of personal experience and a dive into the research. Additionally it will explore the impact of the language when creating productive teams, how to remove “just” from our vocabulary, and why this small change can help us be better mentors to the next generation of software engineers. And, of course, the influence of coding assistants and how they can exacerbate this problem, but how we can remain human in the face of whatever new technology comes our way.
