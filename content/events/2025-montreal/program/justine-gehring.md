AI’s potential in software development extends far beyond code generation or chatbot-style assistants in the IDE. This talk explores how five families of AI capabilities (Learning & Onboarding, Coding Assistants, Automation & Agents, Planning, and Data Exploration & Synthesis) can transform the entire CI/CD lifecycle. Whether it’s assessing processes, building pipelines, planning large-scale VM migrations, or summarizing an ocean of information, we’ll talk about how to identify high-impact integration points often untapped by chatbot or IDE based AI integrations. Centering AI integration around developers throughout the entire lifecycle of planning, coding, deployment, and monitoring unlocks greater ROI than simply generating more lines of code.
