The year is 2025 - you built your digital systems on the cloud, or maybe you want to, and to your frustration and surprise, there are so many digital services that are still run by non-Canadian providers. What does this mean for Canadians and what can you do? In this talk, I will share my research on what it takes to build a digital life that is (mostly) Canadian, what is missing and where we can push for a change. Iâ€™ll also raise important questions about digital sovereignty and operational resilience: How can we ensure that Canadian businesses remain in control of their systems amid growing global uncertainty?This session invites attendees to consider DevOps beyond deployment pipelines, expanding the conversation to how the infrastructure decisions we make shape the autonomy and future of the Canadian digital economy.Consider the Maple Cloud, and how we can be part of it.
