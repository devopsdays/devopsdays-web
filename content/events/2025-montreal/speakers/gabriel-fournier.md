Gabriel learnt BASIC whilst reading his graphing calculator's manual and trying stuff.
It wouldn't occur to him that he'd just learnt programming out of boredom in his classes until a few months later.

Twenty years and many languages later, Gabriel is still trying most anything that takes his fancy. Or might solve his current issue.
Things will most likely not work, and yet provide very useful learning experiences.

What's the worst that could happen if we try this new and shiny tool?
