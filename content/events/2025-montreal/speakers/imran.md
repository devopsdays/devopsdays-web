I've been in the industry for about 6 years now, currently contracting for CIBC where I build out the platform to enable teams to deploy their code to production quickly, safely, and efficiently.

Previously, I worked at Container Solutions as a Cloud Engineer, enabling teams to shift to a cloud native mindset along with DevOps best practices. We worked on a variety of cloud + kubernetes solutions.
