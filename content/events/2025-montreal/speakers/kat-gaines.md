Kat leads Developer Relations at PagerDuty. She has been thinking and talking about incident response and incident management for the last 11 years, and loves discussing these topics alongside customer support, and automating the creation of a delightful end-user and employee experience. In her spare time, Kat is a mediocre plant parent and a slightly less mediocre pet parent to her two rabbits, Lupin and Ginny.
