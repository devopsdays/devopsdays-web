I'm a DevOps Consultant, and have been working in tech since last century. I'm passionate about technology, and started my career as a systems administrator - I love understanding how computers work, and making computers work. The power behind the cloud fascinated me when I was first introduced to it some 15 years ago, and I never looked back, which doesn't mean I don't have very strong opinions about where we are going and how we are building our systems. I have seen computers evolve a lot, which means I like to think of the future, and how we can use this knowledge to make the world a better place.
