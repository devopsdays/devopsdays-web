Services are the backbone of our systems. They are the pieces that make up our businesses—whether they are literal microservices or functional components of a traditional application, we can’t do the computer thing without services.

When it comes to a service in your company or organization, who’s responsible for it? The cast of characters involved in the lifecycle of a service is more than just software engineers. It can include program managers, product owners, sustainability teams (SREs/operations engineers), and business stakeholders, just to name a few.

Topics covered in this talk include: – Defining what a service means to you and your organization – Roles in service ownership – What are you observing about your service? – How you want a team to respond to a service outage or incident – Managing your service in production – Tuning your service – Understanding how the service impacts the business.
