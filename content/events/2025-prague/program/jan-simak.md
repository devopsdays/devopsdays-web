I joined the UK based teams a year ago as their line manager. Throughout the year I learnt a lot and had to solve many difficulties related to my remote setting, language, a slightly different negotiation style and much more. On top of that, I must have changed my daily regime to align with the remote site and e.g. I would have never thought that even one hour time difference might cause some hard to solve troubles. I would like to share my experience with the audience and ignite “off the scene” talks on this topic as I do believe there are many people considering the same that might be curious or others having similar experiences so that I’m keen to listen to their story.
