I started as an IT passionate guy living all days in a dark terminal. A couple of years later I realised that I’m more happy talking to people and helping them to succeed. So I decided to breakout from my cozy and well equipped dark terminal and started learning leadership which has shifted my carrier towards being responsible for people and projects. Several years later, I still do think this was right decision. Being a leader is a huge challenge and still so many things to learn.

My motto: I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I’m going to learn, I must do it by listening (Larry King).
