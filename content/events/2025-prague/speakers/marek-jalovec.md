I’ve been crafting software for 23 years—long enough to remember the joy of debugging for Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator. My first software ran on an 8-bit computer, and I wrote my first “serious” desktop app for Windows 95 using Delphi 3 (Object Pascal). Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: running my own web hosting company complete with a self-built “datacenter” in 2008, diving into mobile app development for the iPhone in 2009, and moving to cloud-based web applications in 2010.

My path has zigzagged between engineering and leadership, but since 2018, I’ve leaned fully into people management. Currently, I lead IT, Cybersecurity, CloudOps, and Technical Writing at FINN, a German scale-up making mobility frictionless and flexible for both B2C and B2B customers. I thrive at the intersection of technology and security, problem-solving, and building teams that drive innovation.
