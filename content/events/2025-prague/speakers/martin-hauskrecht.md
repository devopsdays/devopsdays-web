Head of Engineering at Labyrinth Labs TLDR DevOps newsletter Curator
My main focus is designing full-featured cloud infrastructures on AWS and Azure. Over the past couple of years, I gained experience building robust, auto-scaled, and highly-available cloud environments for many customers and applications, utilising a large set of tools and technologies during the process, mainly revolving around Kubernetes and Serverless. I like to work on challenging tasks, and always want to learn something new. Iâ€™ve wrote couple of blog posts mainly focused on observability tools and challenges I needed to solve and developed/contributed to couple of open-source tools used across the DevOps community.
