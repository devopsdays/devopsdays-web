## DevOpsDays Raleigh 2025 Has Been Cancelled

Unfortunately, we have to cancel DevOpsDays Raleigh 2025. Tickets and sponsorships will be refunded in full. We are incredibly sorry as this has been a great community driven event the past decade for tech professionals and enthusiasts to gather, collaborate, and learn. Don't worry though, we WILL be back for 2026! Mark your calendars, we are tentatively scheduled for April 15th and 16th at the <a href="https://lifelonglearning.ncsu.edu/mckimmon-conference-and-training-center/">McKimmon Center</a>.
