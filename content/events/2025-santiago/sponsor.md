      <p>* If the conference is cancelled due to events beyond our control (e.g. venue closure or government edict) we will do our best to reimburse everyone we can; this is dependent on obtaining a refund from our venue based on force majeure and we cannot absolutely guarantee this will happen.  Please let us know if your sponsorship is dependent on the hybrid event taking place before you make your sponsorship payment.</p>

<p>Devopsdays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists.</p>
<p>Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.</p>
<!--
There are also opportunities for exclusive special sponsorships. We'll have sponsors for various events with special privileges for the sponsors of these events. If you are interested in special sponsorships or have a creative idea about how you can support the event, send us an email.
