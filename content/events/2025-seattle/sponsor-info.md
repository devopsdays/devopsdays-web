## Thank you for sponsoring DevOpsDays Seattle

As you probably know, DevOpsDays is a volunteer run not-for-profit event. Our goal is to help people learn about DevOps, and we couldn’t do it without your support. Thank You!!

### Book your hotel rooms

A lot of hotels in Seattle sell out in the spring. It’s a good idea to book any rooms you’ll need as soon as possible. We don't have an official hotel, but there are many in the area.

### Register your attendees

You’ll receive a registration code to be given to people who will be attending on behalf of your company. Please don’t wait to have them register once you receive your code! We’d like to have an accurate count as soon as possible.

## Who to send

Of course this is up to you, but most attendees will be hands-on practitioners. It’s
important to your success that you send people able to have practitioner level
conversations. If you’re showing off your latest product, be ready to answer
some technical questions. If you’re looking to hire people, have someone there
who works in the type of role you’re hiring for. There will be a job board avialable during the event for anyone to share open roles and contact details.

### Conference Format

DevOpsDays is a unique blend of presentation style talks and interactive open
discussions. The presentations are being chosen from over 200 submissions. We’re
really excited about the talks we’ll see.

The afternoons are run as open spaces. You can learn more about this format
at <https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/>. To make the most of your
participation it’s highly recommended that your staff participate in the open
space discussions. This is your best chance to show off how valuable you can
be to the attendees. Open space topics are proposed and voted for by attendees, we encourage you to submit ideas as well.

### Shipping, Loading Dock

The venue manages all shipping requests, plan to have packages arrive on September 7th for the setup day on September 8th. All the details can be found on their site - <https://www.meydenbauer.com/convention-center/exhibitors/shipping-receiving/>.

Sponsors are welcome coordinate with venue to use their loading dock - <https://www.meydenbauer.com/convention-center/exhibitors/move-in-out/>.

### Sponsor Tables

Gold sponsors will be able to choose the location in the venue of your sponsor table. Once sponsors have finalized attendance with payment, we will share a Google Drive document to track all action items, share sponsor-specific details, manage the logo, and share any additional information. It will also contain a section to indicate table location prefferences (allocated by sponsorship level, and then by payment received date). We will send out an email to sponsors on 21 August for table allocation finalization, it is important to respond to this email as soon as possible to secure final table allocations. With that said, we've been told that we have one of the most welcoming sponsor areas of any DevOpsDays event and will do everything in our power to make sure there's no such thing as a "bad table spot".

### A/V Rental<a id="av_rental">

A/V rental is available directly from the venue. All tables will have power and access to the shared wireless service. Anything else you require can be ordered from the venue - <https://www.meydenbauer.com/convention-center/exhibitors/order-technical-services/>.

### Lead Collection / Prize Draw

We don’t share attendee information with sponsors.

You’re welcome to ask people to share their contact information voluntarily. Approaches that have worked well in the past include doing a raffle for a prize at the end of the event, handing out swag and/or free trials (or credit vouchers) for your product, participating in a challenge to win a prize, etc. Types of prizes that have been well received: (exclusive) Lego sets, wireless headphones, mechanical keyboards, etc - the more interesting, the more people will want to enter. Try to make it as easy as possible for attendees to share their details, a short URL or QR code they can scan to direct them to a page or form to enter, or paper to add their details into a bowl for the draw. The draw will be done during the closing session on the last day, and prize winners need to be preset to accept their prizes, so make sure to have at least a few backup winners.
