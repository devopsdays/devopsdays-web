Too often, threat modeling becomes a check-the-box exercise where teams ask the same generic questions for every component and struggle to see meaningful outcomes. This session explores how to move beyond that by applying a risk-centric approach through the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA), a methodology designed to align technical threats with business impact, architecture, and operational context. We will discuss how threat modeling can serve as a central, unifying activity that brings together security efforts across vulnerability management, threat intelligence, and architectural risk.
