### Talk

After building multiple GenAI PoCs, MISSION+ noticed that many companies want to “do AI”, but don’t really know what that means. In the dash to produce something, risk functions are bypassed, and different teams approach the problem differently - both from a process perspective and technologies chosen.

The AI Adoption Pyramid is a multi-step framework - made up of tools & processes - that helps an organisation lay down: 
* A robust foundation of governance and applicable policies
* Organisational alignment and architecture, where appropriate technologies and processes are established, risks are tracked, and stakeholders are formally identified
* A process for identifying which projects make sense from both an outcome and feasibility perspective

In this talk, we will present the problem, the pyramid, and the tools we use to drive success.
