### Talk

Can AI make Kubernetes smarter? ðŸš€ Absolutely!

Traditional scaling reacts to CPU and memory, but what if you could predict spikes before they happen? This talk reveals how AI-powered predictive scaling with Kubeflow & KEDA can cut costs, prevent downtime, and optimize workloads.

ðŸ”¥ What youâ€™ll learn: 
1) How AI models predict traffic surges & optimize Kubernetes scaling.
2) Automating event-driven scaling with KEDA for real-time response.
3) Building MLOps pipelines in Kubeflow to improve scaling accuracy.
4) Real-world case studies on cost savings & performance gains.
5) Live demo: AI + Kubernetes in action!

Join us to supercharge your Kubernetes scaling with AI and MLOps! ðŸš€
