### Talk

Traditional IaC tools like Terraform and CloudFormation are hitting their limits. While AWS CDK introduced a better developer experience, it remains bound to CloudFormation’s constraints. Pulumi offers an alternative, but its adoption is hindered by the dominance of Terraform tooling. In this talk, we’ll explore:

* Why Terraform’s module format is fundamentally broken for modern IaC needs
* The limitations of AWS CDK and Pulumi, and how CDKTF provides a better path
* Lessons learned from months of converting AWS CDK to CDKTF
* How GenAI-powered automation is significantly accelerating this process

This session will showcase real-world GenAI automation workflows and practical takeaways for teams looking to future-proof their IaC strategy. If you’re struggling with Terraform’s limitations and wondering how AI can improve DevOps workflows, this talk is for you.
