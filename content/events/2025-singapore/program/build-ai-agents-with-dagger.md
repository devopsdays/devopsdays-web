### Ignite

Dagger is best known as an open source container engine that vastly improves CI by allowing pipelines to be defined as code, in a team's preferred programming language. But Dagger is actually a complete runtime and programming environment for distributed applications, with unique features such as repeatability, caching, tracing, platform independence, and a cross-language ecosystem of pluggable modules.

Besides complex build and test workflows, these features are perfect for complex AI workflows.

This talk discusses Dagger's approach to managing the increasing complexity of AI workflows and demonstrates how it is a game-changer for building and running AI agents. It showcases how Dagger's repeatability, caching and tracing features align perfectly with the demands of the exploding AI ecosystem.

**Key Takeaways**

- This session will highlight the benefits - simplicity, speed and repeatability - of using Dagger to build and run agentic workflows. 
- It will include a "live demo" of building a Dagger-powered AI agent with just a few lines of code, illustrating the massive improvement in development experience offered by Dagger as compared to traditional approaches. 
- Attendees will leave equipped with insight into an innovative and exciting new approach to building and running AI agents!
