DevOps Dating Advice: Swipe Right on AI Collaboration ❤️🤖🚀 AI is sliding into DevOps DMs, promising automation, speed, and efficiency. But is it the perfect match or a walking red flag? Just like dating, AI in DevOps can be thrilling but also unpredictable. Can you trust it with your deployments? Will it help during an outage or ghost you at the worst moment? This talk takes a fun, relatable approach to AI adoption in DevOps, helping teams navigate this new “relationship” with humor and real-world insights. We will cover the following:

💘 Finding the Right Match – Choosing AI tools that improve workflows instead of creating chaos. 👀 The First Date Test – Start small before committing to full AI automation. 🚩 Red Flags & Green Flags – Recognizing when AI is helping vs. when it’s a liability. 🔒 Setting Boundaries – ensuring AI remains an assistant, not the boss of your DevOps pipeline. 💍 Long-Term Commitment – Using AI effectively without building future tech debt.

Whether you’re AI-curious or already in a love-hate relationship with automation, this talk will help you swipe right on the right AI strategies—without the heartbreak!
