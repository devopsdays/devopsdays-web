### Keynote

Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen DevSecOps evolve dramatically — and in this session, we’ll take a closer look at that journey. Together, we’ll explore how security 
has shifted from being an afterthought to becoming an integral part of the development process. We’ll reflect on how tooling has improved, empowering developers and 
operations teams to build secure software without sacrificing speed or innovation.

We’ll also dive into some of the key trends shaping the future, including how AI is transforming security practices and why Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) 
is becoming essential for managing risk at scale.

Whether you’re just starting with DevSecOps or looking to refine your approach, this talk will provide practical insights and a clear vision of what’s next — and how we can all prepare for the road ahead.
