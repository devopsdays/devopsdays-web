### Ignite

Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform, yet managing clusters across multiple environments remains challenging. Teams face inconsistent provisioning, high operational overhead, complex upgrades, and security risks—especially with ClusterAPI (CAPI), which requires intricate YAML configurations and multi-component integrations. k0rdent is a Kubernetes-native Distributed Container Management Environment (DCME) that eliminates these complexities. Acting as a “super control plane,” k0rdent streamlines lifecycle management using CAPI, Sveltos, and a templated approach to ensure automation, version compatibility, and built-in observability. In this talk, we’ll explore how k0rdent:

1. Simplifies multi-cloud and hybrid Kubernetes operations.
2. Reduces CAPI’s complexity with easy-to-use templates.
3. Ensures tested, version-pinned integrations across components.
4. Provides policy-based add-on management via Sveltos.
5. Offers observability for both management and workload clusters.
