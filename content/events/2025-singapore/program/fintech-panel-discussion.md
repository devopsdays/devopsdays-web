### DevOps meets AI in Singapore Financial Hub

Our 10th anniversary stands out with a focus on infrastructure, machine learning, and data analytics—key drivers of FinTech innovation. Let’s come together in Singapore, the heart of global FinTech, to explore how DevOps and AI can revolutionize financial services

Singapore is a FinTech powerhouse—home to over 1,000 FinTech firms and the world’s largest FinTech festival (Singapore FinTech Festival, attracting 66,000+ attendees in 2024). Backed by initiatives like the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) FinTech Regulatory Sandbox and a S$1bn investment in AI through the National AI Strategy 2.0, the city is at the forefront of financial innovation. At DevOpsDays Singapore, our panel of industry leaders will discuss how Singapore’s FinTech ecosystem is leveraging AI to transform DevOps practices, from accelerating CI/CD pipelines to enhancing fraud detection and compliance through machine learning. Join us to explore the future of FinTech and DevOps!
