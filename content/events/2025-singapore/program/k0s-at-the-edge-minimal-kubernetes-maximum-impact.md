### Ignite

Struggling to deploy AI at the edge? Enter k0s, a single-binary Kubernetes distro which slashes setup time to minutes on a $100 Raspberry Pi 5. Perfect for scaling AI workloads without cloud lock-in. See a live demo and unlock tomorrow’s smart infrastructure, today.

As enterprises rush to deploy AI at the edge, think retail analytics, IoT diagnostics, or low-latency inferencing, they face infrastructure bottlenecks, including constrained hardware, fragmented environments, and unreliable connectivity. Kubernetes is key to scaling AI workloads, but traditional distributions are too heavy for edge nodes. Enter k0s, a single-binary Kubernetes distro that runs on a Raspberry Pi.

In this lightning talk, you’ll see how k0s:
* Cuts deployment friction for edge AI with a 2-minute cluster setup,
* Slashes resource overhead, freeing up compute.
* Future-proofs your stack by decoupling from cloud vendors, critical as AI tools evolve monthly.
