### Ignite

Istio has emerged as one of the most prominent service mesh solutions in the Kubernetes ecosystem. However, as new projects onboard to Istio, setting up effective monitoring becomes a critical task. As a tier-0 component of any K8s-based cloud platform, the service mesh plays a vital role in ensuring system stability—and designing the right alerting strategy is essential to prevent revenue-impacting incidents.

At Expedia Group, we conducted an extensive analysis of Istio’s observability stack. Our deep dive into the Istio control plane revealed key signals and common failure modes. Using this knowledge, we developed a robust approach to alerting and implemented proactive measures to mitigate potential failures.

In this session, we will share the results of our comprehensive study. Attendees will gain actionable insights into monitoring Istio effectively and understand the best practices for establishing alerts that can safeguard platform reliability.
