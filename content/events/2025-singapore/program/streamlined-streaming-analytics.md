### Ignite

Developers often face a steep learning curve with streaming analytics - battling complex configurations, version conflicts, and integration headaches. This demo-driven session cuts through the complexity, showing how to build production-ready streaming pipelines using open-source tools in your local environment.

Through live coding, we’ll construct a complete streaming analytics pipeline from scratch. You’ll learn battle-tested patterns for source integration, data transformations, and real-time visualization that translate directly to production environments. Watch as we build an end-to-end system using Apache Iceberg for reliable storage and Streamlit for dynamic dashboards, demonstrating how modern open-source tools can reduce weeks of setup to minutes of actual development.

Key Takeaways
* Proven patterns for local development that mirror production architectures
* Common pitfalls in streaming pipelines and how to avoid them
* Practical techniques for testing and debugging real-time data flows
