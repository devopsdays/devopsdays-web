### Talk

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, agentic AI has emerged as a powerful paradigm for creating intelligent agents capable of interacting with the real world. However, building and deploying such agents can be complex and time-consuming. This demo-driven talk will introduce a new approach to cloud-native scaffolding using software templates that significantly simplify the development of agentic AI projects, providing a streamlined and efficient experience for app developers.

Through a series of live demonstrations, attendees will witness firsthand how this innovative scaffolding framework can accelerate the development lifecycle of agentic AI applications. We will explore key features such as automated code generation, pre-configured infrastructure, and integration with popular AI libraries, demonstrating how these tools can save developers valuable time and effort.

By the end of this talk, participants will clearly understand how this new approach to cloud-native scaffolding can revolutionize the development of agentic AI projects. They will be equipped with the knowledge and practical skills needed to build intelligent agents more efficiently and effectively, driving innovation in artificial intelligence.
