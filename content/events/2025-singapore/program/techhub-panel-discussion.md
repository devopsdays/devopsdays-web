### DevOps meets AI in Singapore Tech Hub

Our 10th anniversary isn’t like the others—we’re focusing on the technologies shaping the future: infrastructure, machine learning, and data analytics. Let’s come together in Singapore, a city at the forefront of tech innovation, to explore how DevOps and AI can transform the way we work. 

Singapore has emerged as a powerhouse in the tech world—ranked third globally in AI investment, innovation, and implementation (Global AI Index, Tortoise Media)—and is home to groundbreaking initiatives like the National AI Strategy 2.0, with S$1bn committed to AI development over the next five years. At DevOpsDays Singapore, we’re proud to host a panel of industry leaders who will discuss how Singapore’s tech ecosystem is driving the convergence of DevOps and AI, fostering innovation in infrastructure, machine learning, and data analytics. Join us to hear their insights on how organizations can thrive in an AI-driven era!
