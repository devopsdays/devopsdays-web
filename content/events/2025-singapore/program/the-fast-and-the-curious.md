### Ignite

Deploying AI on Kubernetes sounds great—until you hit the reality of scalability bottlenecks, GPU resource struggles, and skyrocketing costs. This session tackles these challenges head-on, showcasing how k0rdent automates the entire AI infrastructure lifecycle to make AI workloads efficient, scalable, and cost-effective.

**What You’ll See in Action:**
* Effortless Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning
  - Seamlessly spin up AI-ready clusters **across clouds and on-prem** with k0rdent.
* GPU Acceleration, Minus the Hassle
  - Automate GPU setup with NVIDIA GPU Operator, ensuring smooth AI training and inference.
* AI Model Deployment, the Smart Way
  - Expose models as scalable APIs using KServe, making AI inference easy.
* Auto-Scaling That Saves You Money
  - Knative dynamically adjusts GPU resources—scaling up when needed, scaling to zero when idle.
* Stay in Control with Proactive Monitoring
  - Track AI performance and GPU usage in real-time with Prometheus and Grafana.
