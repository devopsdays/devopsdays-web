### Talk

Bringing AI/ML workloads on-prem, especially into air-gapped environments, presents unique hurdles beyond typical cloud deployments. This session dives into the practical DevOps strategies required to succeed. We'll explore tackling challenges like managing complex infrastructure (GPUs!), handling large datasets securely, automating model pipelines without external access, and maintaining tooling/dependencies offline. Leave with actionable insights on adapting CI/CD, IaC, and MLOps practices to deliver AI value securely within highly restricted networks.
