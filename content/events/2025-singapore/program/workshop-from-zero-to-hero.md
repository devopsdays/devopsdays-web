### Workshop

This 3-hour hands-on workshop is designed to equip enterprise Java developers with the essential skills and knowledge to harness artificial intelligenceâ€™s power in their projects. Developers learn:

* How to modernize and deploy Java AI-infused applications across teams using internal developer portals
* Understand developer AI concepts like prompt engineering, application testing, applying RAG patterns, observing AI-infused applications, and using tools/agents
* Experiment with models and applications directly on the desktop with AI-focused local development tools
* Building AI applications with S/W templates and deploying to Kubernetes
Easy fine-tuning of base models using open source tools

The workshop equips enterprise Java developers with the essential skills to leverage artificial intelligence. Participants will learn about prompts, RAG, tools, embedding, model testing, and the Backstage software template. Through hands-on exercises, attendees will gain practical experience building and testing AI models, exploring prompting techniques, and integrating AI into their Java projects. By the end of the workshop, participants will be well-equipped to solve complex business problems using AI.
