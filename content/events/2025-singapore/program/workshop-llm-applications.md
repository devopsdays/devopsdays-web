### Workshop

The workshop combines architectural discussions with hands-on implementation. Developers will: - Write code for each major component of an LLM application - Debug common failure patterns in RAG implementations - Deploy monitoring solutions for tracking application health - Optimize response quality through systematic evaluation - Implement security best practices for production deployment

#### Workshop Agenda
Foundations and Environment Setup (15 minutes) - Understanding LLM architectures and serverless deployment patterns - Setting up the development environment and required dependencies - Introduction to core APIs and development patterns - Overview of production-grade fine-tuning approaches

Building RAG-enabled Applications (45 minutes) - Implementing vector search for efficient context retrieval - Developing interactive chat interfaces with Python web frameworks - Building end-to-end RAG pipelines with proper error handling - Hands-on: Creating a real-time contextual chatbot

Application Observability and Evaluation (20 minutes) - Implementing comprehensive LLM application monitoring - Adding evaluation metrics and performance tracking - Deploying guardrails for enhanced reliability - Hands-on: run batches of evaluations

Integration and Next Steps (10 minutes) - Best practices for production deployment - Common pitfalls and debugging strategies - Scaling considerations and optimization techniques - Open discussion and resource sharing

Key Takeaways
Design and implement RAG architectures with hybrid search for enhanced context handling
Build responsive chat interfaces using modern Python frameworks
Deploy production-ready observability for LLM applications
Implement guardrails and evaluation metrics for application reliability
Debug and optimize LLM application performance at scale
