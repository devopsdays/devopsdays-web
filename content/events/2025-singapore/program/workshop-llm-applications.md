### Workshop

The workshop combines architectural discussions with hands-on implementation. Developers will: - Write code for each major component of an LLM application - Debug common failure patterns in RAG implementations - Deploy monitoring solutions for tracking application health - Optimize response quality through systematic evaluation - Implement security best practices for production deployment

#### Target Audience

Software engineers and ML practitioners who want to move beyond basic LLM integrations to building production-grade applications.

#### Workshop Agenda

1. (15min) Foundations and Environment Setup
- Understanding LLM architectures and serverless deployment patterns
- Setting up the development environment and required dependencies
- Introduction to core APIs and development patterns
- Overview of production-grade fine-tuning approaches

2. (45min) Building RAG-enabled Applications
- Implementing vector search for efficient context retrieval
- Developing interactive chat interfaces with Python web frameworks
- Building end-to-end RAG pipelines with proper error handling
- Hands-on: Creating a real-time contextual chatbot

3. (20min) Application Observability and Evaluation
 - Implementing comprehensive LLM application monitoring
 - Adding evaluation metrics and performance tracking
 - Deploying guardrails for enhanced reliability
 - Hands-on: run batches of evaluations

4. (10min) Integration and Next Steps
 - Best practices for production deployment
 - Common pitfalls and debugging strategies
 - Scaling considerations and optimization techniques
 - Open discussion and resource sharing
