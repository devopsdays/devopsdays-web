### Workshop

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models using Prompt Engineering. There is an overview of the risks of Generative AI and the layered defence-in-depth approach that can be used to mitigate them, and then an opportunity to explore some prompt engineering techniques in an AI Playground.

#### Target Audience

Bring your laptop along, but do not worry, you can finish the workshop at home at your own pace.

#### Workshop Overview

* Generative AI models can generate human like text, images, and code
* Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
* Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 from OpenAI with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
* Azure OpenAI Service provides a simple REST API for accessing these models
* Prompt engineering is a technique for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of their output, provide factual information, and constrain their behavior.

#### Key Takeaways

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
* Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
* Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
* Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own generative AI solutions

**Benefits for Developers**, who often work on building applications, integrating AI models, or creating data pipelines.  Here are two benefits:
* Improved AI Model Interaction for Faster Development  
* Enhanced Data Pipeline Automation with AI-Driven Insights  

**Benefits for Operations Teams**, responsible for managing infrastructure, ensuring system reliability, and optimizing workflows (key aspects of DevOps), can also benefit from prompt engineering skills, particularly in an AI-driven DevOps environment. Here are two benefits:
* Streamlined Incident Management with AI-Assisted Troubleshooting  
* Optimized Infrastructure Management with AI-Driven Automation  


#### Prerequisites for Participants
* Use your own laptop.
* Launch a modern browser. (Use edge or chrome for the best experience)
* GitHub username and access to the internet. They can access the workshop materials and the AI Playground for a month after the Conference.
