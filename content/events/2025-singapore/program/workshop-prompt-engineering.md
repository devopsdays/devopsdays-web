### Workshop

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models using Prompt Engineering. There is an overview of the risks of Generative AI and the layered defence-in-depth approach that can be used to mitigate them, and then an opportunity to explore some prompt engineering techniques in an AI Playground.

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own generative AI solutions
Bring your laptop along, but do not worry, you can finish the workshop at home at your own pace.

Attendees need only a laptop, a GitHub username and access to the internet. They can access the workshop materials and the AI Playground for a month after the Conference.
