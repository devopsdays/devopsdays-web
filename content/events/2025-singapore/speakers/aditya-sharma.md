Computer Science graduate from DTU with a passion for exploring diverse technologies. My journey began with AI/ML research, evolved into full-stack web development, and now focuses on DevOps. 

I have been working in the platform space for approximately 3.5 years, with Istio as my primary service mesh technology throughout this time. My experience spans both functional and non-functional aspects of Istio, and for the past 1.5 years, I have been exclusively focused on enhancing its reliability and resiliency within the platform.
