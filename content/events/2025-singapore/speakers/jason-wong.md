Jason is Senior Support Engineer in ClickHouse Cloud across the globe. Actively engaging with customers to solve realtime analytics challenges, running trainings to enable customers and developers.  

Being a big data engineer for the last decade, standing at the tip of the engineering world, bridging the big data technology between end user and the software / products. Despite of the technical side, the most challenging thing is to enable end users on how to leverage big data to make life easier. And that is the reason why I have transited from fullstack developer to consultant / trainer, in which I would have more time and chances to communicate with end users and to understood their real use cases.
