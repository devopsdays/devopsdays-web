Ned Lowe is the CTO of MISSION+, where he helps interesting people build interesting products with fractional CTOs & nearshore development teams. He is passionate about building tech teams and reducing complexity in the product development process until it is “Uncomfortably Simple”.

Ned has a burning passion for technology — he picked up coding at the age of 8 and had always envisioned himself being a chip designer as he studied for his Masters of Engineering at Imperial College London. When not evangelising technology to anyone who will listen, he is usually found deadlifting or drinking whisky - although not at the same time.
