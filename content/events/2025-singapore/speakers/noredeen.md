I’m a software engineer on the developer experience team at Notion, where I work on local development and continuous integration. I was previously part of the developer productivity team at Temporal where I worked on internal data ingress. I’m passionate about empowering developers and have spent most of my career building software for engineers, whether coworkers or end users. 
I’m particularly interested in programming languages, how they are evolving to fit the needs of contemporary software teams, and how their impact can be measured. Beyond technology, my interests include music history, urban advocacy, and documentaries.
