Head of Engineering & Architecture at GIC

My primary work motivation is delivering systems that improve user productivity and impact the bottom line of the business.

While possessing strong technical ability and experience, I see software development as primarily being about people â€“ getting the right people together and interacting in the right way. As such I relish collaborating with the business, understanding their problems and working together to solve them.

I value efficiency and quality in development, and ensure teams I am involved with understand the need to continually strive for improvement on these fronts - and never to compromise in these areas.
