  <p>Can you believe it is 10 years since we ran the first <strong>DevOpsDays</strong> in Singapore ? For our <strong>10 Years</strong> anniversary edition we are bringing back the workshop track.</p>
  <p>Please come and celebrate this event with us, the event will be held on <strong>14th & 15th May</strong>, at the <a href="../location">Stephen Riady Auditorium @ NTUC</a> in Singapore. We expect <strong>over 400 attendees</strong> this year. </p>
  <p><a href="../location">Look for Nearby Hotels</a></p>
  <p>Our theme this year is the **DevOps Meets AI**: Transforming Engineering with Generative AI Tools. While the potential of GenAI is exciting, as DevOps practitioners we need to acknowledge several concerns that organizations must address. The entire AI technology stack is changing on a month-to-month basis, making it challenging for enterprises accustomed to more stable, long-term technology investments. We encourage people with technology and business background to attend, learn and share experiences.

  <h3>Your DevOpsDays Singapore Experience</h3>
  <p>Each day starts with <strong>two keynotes</strong> and <strong>three expert talks</strong> in technology and tech culture. After lunch we have a panel discussion followed by a <strong>series of lightning talks</strong> and then self-organize a series of small groups called openspaces. In these openspaces, attendees share and discuss their knowledge on a specific point topic of interest. Youâ€™ll find many opportunities to participate, engage, and discuss with your peers at DevOpsDays Singapore!</p>
