        <h4 class="speaker-bio-talks">Engineering's Quest for Responsible Efficiency</h3>
        <p>When done right, efficiency enables access—this fundamental principle drives responsible engineering practices. A low cost operating platform means you can expand access, serving customers and use cases that may have been underserved or ignored previously. Drawing from Nubank's real-world examples, this talk explores how efficiency frequently provides optionality in engineering decisions while demonstrating practical approaches to pursue it responsibly. We'll examine specific strategies such as differentiating between demand and supply side approaches, and measuring efficiency of entire value chains and flows rather than optimizing individual services or components in isolation. Join us to discover how the quest for responsible efficiency can transform technical operations while expanding reach.

We're excited to announce DevOpsDays DC 2025 on September 17-18, 2025!

We'll be back at the {{< event_link page="location" text="American Red Cross Headquarters" >}} in Washington, DC. It's an amazing venue with a lot of history.

We're also excited to be teaming up again with [Kubernetes Community Day DC](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-washington-dc-presents-kcd-washington-dc-2025/) who will be hosting their event on September 16, 2025! Whether you are a developer, ops pro, system engineer, or any other IT professional excited about cloud native technologies, Kubernetes Community Days DC (KCD DC) will have something for you. Supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, their 2024 event will also be hosted at the historic national headquarters of the American Red Cross. This full-day conference will focus on knowledge sharing, best practices, and new developments in and around Kubernetes.

## Efficiency & Productivity
For this year's DevOpsDays DC, we're exploring how modern DevOps practices can transform organizational efficiency and team productivity in an era where doing more with less has become the expectation rather than the exception. We're seeking presentations that showcase innovative approaches to applying technology, streamlining workflows, reducing cognitive load, eliminating wasteful processes, and creating sustainable practices that enhance both delivery speed and quality. Whether you're implementing platform engineering solutions, rethinking your CI/CD pipeline, integrating AI tools, or cultivating psychological safety, we want to hear your success stories—and not-so-success stories that led to profound improvements. The most compelling talks will offer actionable insights backed by real-world experiences, providing our audience with both strategic frameworks and tactical solutions they can implement immediately. Join us in shaping the conversation around how DevOps can be the catalyst for meaningful productivity enhancements that benefit both organizations and the humans who power them.
