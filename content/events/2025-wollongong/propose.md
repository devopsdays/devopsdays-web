Here are the talk formats you can propose for DevOpsDays Wollongong:

**Keynote Talk**: These are ~45 minute presentations that kick off each day of the conference. These talks are sourced via both invitation and CFP process. These are generally broadly applicable and delivered by experienced presenters, developer advocates, and industry leaders.

**30-Minute Talk**: These are standard conference sessions, typically scheduled in the mornings. Please reach out to us if you'd like help shaping this up.

**Ignite Talk**: Got a quick, impactful idea? Ignite talks are 5-minute blasts with 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds. You can learn more about [the Ignite format here](/ignite-talks-format/).

**Open Space**: No need to submit a proposal beforehand for this one! If you'd like to lead a group discussion during the attendee-suggested [Open Space](/open-space-format/) breakout sessions, you can suggest your topic in person at the conference.

Please note: if you're looking to demo your product or service, that's best done by [sponsoring the event](./sponsor/) and showcasing it at your sponsor table.

Choosing talks for DevOpsDays Wollongong is a blend of art and science. We're looking to build the best possible program for our local audience, and here's what we're keeping in mind:

## What We're Looking For

**Broad Appeal**: How will your talk resonate with a diverse crowd? Even deep dives should offer something valuable for everyone in the room, not just those using your specific tools.

**New Local Presenters**: We want to hear your story! We're particularly keen to highlight the challenges and successes experienced right here in the Illawarra region. If you're new to speaking, don't sweat it â€“ we're happy to offer guidance and coaching.

**Under-represented Voices**: All voices are welcome. If you're in a less conventional tech field, part of a large traditional organisation, or simply have a unique background, we're eager to hear about your experiences.

**Original Content**: While we'll consider talks presented elsewhere, we much prefer content that our local community hasn't likely seen before.

**No Third-Party Submissions**: This is a community-driven event. Speakers need to be directly engaged with us and the attendees. If a PR firm or marketing department is pitching your talk, it tells us you're a bit removed from the process.

**No Vendor Pitches**: We value our vendors and sponsors immensely, but we won't accept talks that are product sales pitches.
