DevOpsDays are community-focused, self-organising conferences for devops practitioners that depend on sponsor support. Because of the nature of the event, we do not have a large noisy vendor hall or vendor speaking slots. We do not offer full speaker slots in return for sponsorship, sponsors are welcome to submit talks however. Platinum and Gold sponsors receive a table they can use for technical and promotional material for interested people to come visit during breaks.

Attendees, including sponsors, are welcome to propose any subject they want during open spaces, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and marketing may work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees. The most effective interaction is to send software engineers, solutions engineers, and developer advocates, to connect with the community at DevOpsDays on their own terms.

We do not ever sell or provide contact details of attendees - this is non negotiable.

Respect and empathy are core DevOps values. DevOpsDays is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone in the DevOps community can learn and share in respectful, considerate collaboration.

The event operates under a [code of conduct available here](https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-wollongong/conduct)
