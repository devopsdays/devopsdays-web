      At DevOpsDays Zürich we don’t want to be a tech-conference only — instead we want to be a conference focusing on knowledge, networking and a connecting atmospheric vibe, welcoming a range of backgrounds, experiences and opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wether you are a speaker or a participant, maybe something’s missing for you?&nbsp;Would you be happy to have some mentoring on your first conference talk? Would you need some assistance in getting to&nbsp;Winterthur? Would you need childcare to be at the conference? Whatever it is, please do not hesitate to contact us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might not have a solution in every case or right away – but you can be sure that we are passionate and eager to find one!
      Here’s among others what we already thought of:
    </p>    
    <ul>
      <li>trying some sort of “diversity in tech”-stream or talk at the conference itself</li>
      <li>have gender neutral toilets (if feasable with the location)</li>
      <li>check the location with zugangsmonitor.ch</li>
      <li>have reserved seating for people with mobility issues</li>
    </ul>
