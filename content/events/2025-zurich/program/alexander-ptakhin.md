### Ignite

Automated pipelines are essential for quality development, but what happens when they start slowing and frustrating us? We’ll explore strategies to minimize context switching and increase developer experience so we can stay in our flow and deliver joyfully.

The talk would be helpful for developers interacting with CI/CD and will cover decreasing pipeline length, local pipeline development, and execution without YAML spaghetti.

Alexander, a Berlin-based tech lead with experience from startups to big tech, is passionate about optimizing processes for better product outcomes.
