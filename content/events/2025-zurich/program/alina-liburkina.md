### Workshop

Discover how Domain-Driven Refactoring can help you transform messy, tightly coupled systems into clean, maintainable architectures.
In legacy systems, wrong abstractions and outdated, database-heavy designs can cause high complexity, a problem reinforced when there are no tests in place. Every change feels risky. Our session will walk you through the process of untangling legacy code using appropriate testing strategies to capture the current behavior and ensure safety as you refactor incrementally.
Once tests are in place, we’ll explore how to clean up the internal mess. Learn step-by-step refactoring techniques towards an expressive domain model. We'll show you how to separate code into its concerns and combine data and logic effectively into cohesive parts. By incorporating business language and identifying domain objects and their boundaries, you’ll start building a true domain model.
We’ll introduce effective automated and manual refactoring techniques to methodically restructure code while keeping everything operational. Finally, we will show techniques that can guide you toward a more flexible architecture, like Vertical Slice and Hexagonal Architecture, where each feature slice is more testable, maintainable, and easy to evolve.
