### Ignite

How can we make Team Topologies actionable in our daily work? As a programmer, I’ve discovered how Extreme Programming (XP) practices can bring these concepts to life. In this ignite talk, I’ll share how methodologies like pair programming, test-driven development, and iterative delivery can help reduce cognitive load, foster effective team interactions, and streamline the flow of value.
