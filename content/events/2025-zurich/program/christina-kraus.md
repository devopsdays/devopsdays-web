### Talk

Platform Engineering is one of the top trends in the cloud-native space right now. However, while the theory behind it is quite clear, implementations are still in their early days. We condense the learnings of our extensive platform building experiences across some of Germany's largest organizations into an informative session that will guide teams in their platform journey.

Platform Engineering is here to relieve developers from the ever increasing cognitive load as the cloud-native tooling landscape grows and DevOps practices or “Shift Left” approaches expand the scope of their responsibility.

In this talk we’ll discuss how an internal platform can help you to effectively model the “new” responsibility split between developers and a platform team. We’ll talk about why developers as the internal “customers” of such platforms play a crucial role for its successful implementation and reveal typical pitfalls you should prevent on your road to a fully automated self-service developer experience.
