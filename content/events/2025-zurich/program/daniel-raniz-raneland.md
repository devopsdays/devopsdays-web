### Talk

Automated pipelines have become an integral part of our daily workflow. As the pipelines become increasingly important, the demands placed on them rise proportionally.

As with many things, a great pipeline operates seamlessly in the background, while a poorly designed one becomes a constant irritation.

Are you publishing your artefacts every time the pipeline runs, running all steps in a sequence, or installing all the tools every time a new build starts?

In this talk, I will address these antipatterns and more I have encountered during my work as a consultant, explaining why I consider them such and what you should do instead.

After listening to this talk, you will better understand what makes a pipeline great and concrete things you can do to improve it and shorten the feedback loop.
