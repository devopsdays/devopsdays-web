### Talk

In today's fast-evolving landscape, adopting Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices is essential for achieving reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency. This talk showcases how GitOps, powered by GitLab CI and Flux, drives this transformation by automating Kubernetes deployments with a declarative, version-controlled approach.
We will demonstrate how to configure Flux as a Kubernetes operator for managing application and infrastructure deployments. This showcases the GitOps 'pull' model, which ensures consistency and resiliency, and contrasts it with the traditional CI/CD 'push' model to highlight the benefits of using Git as the single source of truth.
By the end, attendees will gain practical insights into leveraging GitOps to complement SRE principles through minimizing toil and streamlining their deployment workflows. Plus, attendees will receive exclusive access to a hands-on workshop to explore these concepts in their own environments.
