### Ignite

End-to-end (E2E) testing and monitoring often seem like the best way to ensure software works well, but they can be very costly and break easily. This talk will explain why E2E testing is not the perfect solution it appears to be. Instead, we will show how breaking down the system into smaller parts makes testing and monitoring easier, more flexible, and more reliable.
