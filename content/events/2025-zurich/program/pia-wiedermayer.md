### Talk

My talk will dispel top-experienced myths and highlight realistic benefits about AI and automation in testing.

I am increasingly confronted with the trend: AI in automation and testing first!

Management shouts: "We need to leverage AI". And I wonder: “Even if you don't have a clue why?”
Advertising promises: "Automation will improve quality." And I think: “If you feel that executing the wrong tests faster is an improvement of quality.”
Providers announce: "AI will fix your testing!” And as I shake my head in disbelief, I ask ironically: “You mean like automation did?”
Recruiting rejects applicants: "You need to have a proven record of several years in prompt engineering, AI testing and automation excellence (of course)." And I am speechless.

These hypes are like boomerangs. They keep coming back. Like the mosquitoes in summer that find and maltreat me even when I'm bathed in the strongest insect repellent.

But what remains after a hype (and before the next)?

I will show where hypes like AI and automation have their limits and why human-driven intelligence will never lose its power.

You will realise that it is not an either-or discussion, but a both-and.

You will go back to the office and lead the discussions about the real capabilities of AI and automation in testing.
