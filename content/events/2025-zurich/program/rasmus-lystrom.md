### Ignite

24 years of agile, 17 years of DevOps and 6 years after "Accelerate" got published we see enterprises doing business as usual reaping no real benefits of either agile nor DevOps.

Reflecting back on 10 years as a principal consultant and cloud solution architect at Microsoft working with practically all the major Danish enterprises and a big number of European ones, I want to share my views on why enterprises fail at adopting DevOps and what we should be doing to change that.
