### Workshop

Join us for a hands-on workshop where you'll learn to transform your Kubernetes monitoring from obscurity to full visibility. Discover how to leverage OpenTelemetry to seamlessly integrate metrics, logs, and traces into your observability stack using Mimir, Tempo, Loki, and Grafana.

We'll cover the essentials of deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector to process and export telemetry data efficiently. Learn to set up sidecars and agents to capture comprehensive insights into your services.

Leave uncertainty behind and achieve total operational control.
