### Systems Developer - SciLifeLab

I’m Álvaro Revuelta, a System Developer that works building cloud-native solutions. At SciLifeLab, I develop Python-based applications in containerized Kubernetes environments and streamline deployments with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD. I love sharing knowledge as a public speaker and enjoy volunteering at a cat shelter in Stockholm. Let’s dive into container images, kubernetes and cloud-native practices together!
