### Engineering the operability of SonarQube @ SonarSource
RI am part of the SonarQube team at SonarSource and, together with my colleague Jérémy, I take the responsibility of bringing the best-in-class software operability in private and public cloud to the next level. Have a look at the public GitHub repositories [1,2] that we maintain in my squad!

Previously, I was a senior DevOps engineer and Product Owner for Continuous Integration (CI) and Delivery (CD) tools and DevOps practices at Avaloq, part of NEC Corporation. In this role, I took ownership of build tools and architect the next automation tasks, with the goal of fostering a DevOps mindset within the company.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Zurich (UZH). During my PhD work, I focused on improving CI/CD processes, implementing solutions that help developers avoid anti-patterns and deal better with the required automation. I co-authored 14 articles on CI/CD topics published at top-tier peer-reviewed conferences and journals [3] in the field of software engineering. Before joining UZH, I was a research intern at ING Nederland where I studied how DevOps is transforming the financial services industry.

I am a speaker at international academic (e.g., the International Conference on Software Engineering) and technical (e.g., DevOps Institute Skilup days) conferences. I also enjoy attending local meetups. My slide decks are available at [4].
