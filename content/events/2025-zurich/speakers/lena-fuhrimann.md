### Co-Founder & Cloud Architect @ bespinian

I love cloud-native and serverless software engineering!

I work as an engineer with Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure. As such, I do a lot of development using languages like Go, TypeScript or Python. Modern software engineering needs to be cloud-native or even serverless.

I've worked with more than 100 customers to migrate their products and applications to the cloud.
