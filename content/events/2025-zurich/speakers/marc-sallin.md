### Solution Architect @ Swiss Post
Marc Sallin has been in software development for more than a decade. He became convinced that high speed, quality, and low costs do not compete but form a symbiosis. To tackle the challenges, he takes the definition of software engineering to heart and applies a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to software development, operation, and maintenance. While fascinated by computer science and technology, he learned the importance of team dynamics and psychology in software development. With his ideas, he has been shaping the future of parcel sorting at Swiss Post as a solution architect for five years.
