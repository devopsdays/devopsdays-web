### Senior Golang Engineer

With over 13 years of experience in the computer software industry, I am a seasoned Software Engineer adept at crafting Cloud Native applications and Web applications, primarily utilising Golang, .Net, and React (TypeScript). Throughout my professional journey, I have honed my skills in diverse programming languages such as C#, Golang, and JavaScript. My expertise extends to leveraging various tools and technologies, and I have gained exposure to multiple cloud solutions, including AWS, GCP, and DO.

I thrive on challenges and actively seek projects that push me beyond my comfort zone, allowing me to expand my knowledge and skill set. The continuous pursuit of learning new languages and development techniques is not only a personal passion but also a commitment to contributing to the success of the organisations I work with.
