DevOpsDays Austin is now in its FOURTEENTH year, consistently one of the best attended and reviewed DevOpsDays events on the planet. Sponsor the conference and connect with leaders in the most vibrant tech community in the region. These are the people influencing decisions about security, monitoring, operations, engineering, quality, and product development at leading companies in Central Texas and beyond.

DevOpsDays Austin 2026 will be held at the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA) from May 5-6, 2026, and will accommodate a cap of 320 attendees.

Our theme this year is Value All The Way Down! For our 2026 theme, we’re focusing on something that connects all of us—delivering value to the customer. No matter your title or role, everyone contributes to that goal. This year, it’s all about the real work of value delivery—the wins, the lessons, and the moments that made a difference. Attendees are looking for authentic stories about getting value from start to finish, navigating challenges, and finding better ways to serve customers. Every one of us plays a part in that process, and your experience could inspire others to deliver even more value in their own roles.

### 2025 Demographics

We primarily attract engineers and decision makers like executives and directors, which is apparent again in the past year's demographic data. Engineering disciplines generally are related to automation, CI/CD, SRE, platform engineering, and infrastructure, though we bring in some developers and cybersecurity professionals. We also get a number of consultants, architects, and analysts.

Industries span IT and software providers to consulting and cybersecurity/infosec to finance. We get a fair number of folks from non-IT-focused industries, as well.

### Lead Gathering

Note that, [by global DevOpsDays policy](https://devopsdays.org/organizing#essential-rules-for-organizing:~:text=Sponsors%20are%20much%20appreciated%20for%20their%20financial%20assistance%2C%20and%20they%20are%20welcome%20to%20participate%20in%20devopsdays%20events.%20They%20are%20never%20given%20attendee%20contact%20info%20by%20a%20devopsdays%20event%E2%80%99s%20organizers%2C%20nor%20are%20they%20allowed%20to%20purchase%20speaking%20slots%20for%20talks%20or%20ignites%20at%20a%20devopsdays.), we do not provide lead scanning or lead gathering for you. However, many of our attendees stop by the booths and **actively ask for a large sponsor contingent in our post-event surveys** so they can talk with vendors. As a result, many sponsors get good leads through active, opt-in collection using raffles for popular items (we provide a time at the end of the conference to announce the raffle winner live), web forms, and QR codes for newsletters or communities. We are happy to advise you on ideas we've found work for other sponsors in the past; don't hesitate to ask us!

### Contracts

DevOpsDays Austin is a non-commercial, community-run event, so we do not have formal contracts. Most companies use the prospectus to provide the list of sponsorship benefits if they need something internally. If you have questions about this policy or need more help, email us at {{< email_organizers >}}.

### Ready to sponsor?

We can take payment directly through PayPal, or we can set up an invoice for you. To get an invoice, email us at {{< email_organizers >}}. Otherwise, please reach out to us for a link to our PayPal. We look forward to working with you!
