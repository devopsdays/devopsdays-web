### 2025 Demographics

We primarily attract engineers and decision makers like executives and directors, which is apparent again in the past year's demographic data. Engineering disciplines generally are related to automation, CI/CD, SRE, platform engineering, and infrastructure, though we bring in some developers and cybersecurity professionals. We also get a number of consultants, architects, and analysts.

### Lead Gathering

Note that, [by global DevOpsDays policy](https://devopsdays.org/organizing#essential-rules-for-organizing:~:text=Sponsors%20are%20much%20appreciated%20for%20their%20financial%20assistance%2C%20and%20they%20are%20welcome%20to%20participate%20in%20devopsdays%20events.%20They%20are%20never%20given%20attendee%20contact%20info%20by%20a%20devopsdays%20event%E2%80%99s%20organizers%2C%20nor%20are%20they%20allowed%20to%20purchase%20speaking%20slots%20for%20talks%20or%20ignites%20at%20a%20devopsdays.), we do not provide lead scanning or lead gathering for you. However, many of our attendees stop by the booths and **actively ask for a large sponsor contingent in our post-event surveys** so they can talk with vendors. As a result, many sponsors get good leads through active, opt-in collection using raffles for popular items (we provide a time at the end of the conference to announce the raffle winner live), web forms, and QR codes for newsletters or communities. We are happy to advise you on ideas we've found work for other sponsors in the past; don't hesitate to ask us!
