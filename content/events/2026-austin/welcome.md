        <h2>Welcome to DevOpsDays Austin!</h2>
        <p>DevOpsDays Austin will be on May 5-6, 2026, in the TCEA Conference Center in Austin.</p>
        <p>Our theme this year is Value All The Way Down! For our 2026 theme, we’re focusing on something that connects all of us—delivering value to the customer. No matter your title or role, everyone contributes to that goal. This year, it’s all about the real work of value delivery—the wins, the lessons, and the moments that made a difference. Attendees are looking for authentic stories about getting value from start to finish, navigating challenges, and finding better ways to serve customers. Every one of us plays a part in that process, and your experience could inspire others to deliver even more value in their own roles.</p>
        <!--<p>We have discounted tickets available for Austin locals&mdash;particularly students, people who are unemployed or have income constraints, and members of communities which are under-represented at tech events. <a href="">Please fill out this form</a> (available until the evening of April 30th; if it's down, submissions are closed). Your submission will go to the Austin core organizers (Laura, Rich, & Christa), and we'll respond as quickly as we're able.</p>-->
        <!--<p>New Iron will be joining us again for their free Career Room. Once you've bought your ticket, you can book your time at their Linktree (link available at the conference).</p>-->
