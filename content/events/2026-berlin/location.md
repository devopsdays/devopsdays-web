The DevOpsDays Berlin 2026 conference will take place at the KINDL – Zentrum für zeitgenössische Kunst (KINDL – Centre for Contemporary Art) in Berlin Neukölln. The KINDL is located in a former brewery building, with a huge former Kesselhaus (kettle house) that is used for e.g. site specific art. 

The KINDL also hosts events of all sorts, and in 2026 you can be there, too. 

The industrial complex that is now the KINDL was built between 1926 and 1930 based on a design by architects Hans Claus and Richard Schepke in the style of Expressionism. The Sudhaus with its six giant copper vats—once the largest of their kind in Europe—was previously known as the Palace of Berlin Beer Culture. After its partial destruction in World War II, it was rebuilt in the early 1950s according to plans by the cinema architect Gerhard Fritsche, who also designed the Zoo Palast cinema in Berlin. The conversion of the site, now a protected historical monument, into a centre for contemporary art was the visionary idea of Salome Grisard and Burkhard Varnholt, who acquired the building complex in 2011 and had it carefully renovated. Thanks to the historically sensitive renovation work—for example, the foyer with an exterior stairway in exposed concrete and glass leading to the exhibition areas—the result is a modern venue that can be used in a variety of ways for presenting art, while preserving the industrial character of the building.
