## As always...

If you feel like you have something to say or present at this community event - there are plenty of ways you can engage

- **Give a speak** – 30-45 mins, the stage is yours!
- **Give an ignite talk** — 20 slides, that auto-advances, 30 seconds on each slide, ten minutes in total.
- **Open Space Discussions** — you will not be _speaking_ as such, but facilitate a talk on your topic ...if you can gather a crowd.

Do you have something on your mind?
