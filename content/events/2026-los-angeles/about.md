    <h3>About DevOpsDayLA</h3>
    <h4>Our Story</h4>
    <p>
    Since our first event on July 14, 2010, DevOpsDayLA has been the heart of Southern California's DevOps community. Starting as the region's first DevOps meetup during the early, formative days of the DevOps movement, we became the first DevOps conference in SoCal when we joined SCaLE in 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
    We started organizing just as the DevOps movement was gaining serious momentum—right after John Allspaw and Paul Hammond's legendary "10+ Deploys Per Day" talk had launched the movement at Velocity 2009, and just a month after Velocity 2010 where the DevOps community was really taking shape. We've been part of this revolution from nearly the very beginning.
    </p>
    <h4>15 Events, 16 Years Strong</h4>
    <p>
    2026 marks our 15th event celebrating 16 years of Southern California DevOps community building. Even when COVID forced us to skip 2021, our community stayed strong and came back more connected than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
    We've grown from a small meetup into an annual celebration of local innovation, shared learning, and community connection, while maintaining our core mission: showcasing the work of SoCal DevOps practitioners for SoCal DevOps practitioners.
    </p>
    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
    <p>
    DevOpsDayLA is <strong>BY the SoCal DevOps community, FOR the SoCal DevOps community.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe the best learning comes from practitioners sharing real experiences with their peers. Our goal is to provide a platform where Southern California's DevOps community can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Share their transformation stories and lessons learned</li>
      <li>Learn from challenges and successes happening right in their neighborhood</li>
      <li>Build relationships that extend far beyond the conference
      <li>Celebrate the unique innovations happening across SoCal's diverse tech landscape</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Part of Something Bigger</h4>
    <p>
    As part of the global DevOpsDays movement and the SCaLE conference family, we connect local innovation to worldwide trends while maintaining our focus on community-driven learning and authentic experience sharing.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>DevOpsDays Global:</strong> One of 80+ DevOpsDays events worldwide, part of a movement that emphasizes practitioner-to-practitioner learning and community building.</li>
    <li><strong>SCaLE Partnership:</strong> Co-located with the Southern California Linux Expo since 2011, leveraging shared infrastructure while maintaining our distinct DevOps community focus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What Sets Us Apart</h4>
    <p>
    <strong>Local First</strong><br>
    We prioritize talks from SoCal practitioners sharing experiences from Southern California companies and environments. Your neighborhood knowledge is our most valuable content.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Industry Diversity</strong><br>
    Few tech regions match SoCal's diversity—from entertainment giants to aerospace innovators, from Venice Beach startups to established enterprises. This diversity creates unique DevOps challenges and solutions worth sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Community Over Commerce</strong><br>
    We're volunteer-organized with a focus on authentic knowledge sharing, not vendor pitches. Real practitioners solving real problems for real businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Inclusive by Design</strong><br>
    We actively work to ensure our community represents the full diversity of Southern California's tech ecosystem across geography, industry, company size, experience level, and identity.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
    As we celebrate our 15th event, we're excited about the future of DevOps in Southern California. From AI-enhanced workflows to sustainable software delivery, from platform engineering evolution to edge computing challenges, our community continues to innovate and lead.
    </p>
    <p>
    Join us in 2026 as we write the next chapter of SoCal DevOps history together.
