For years, DevOps improved delivery speed, automation, and feedback loops, which were effective until they began to fail. As the stacks expanded into microservices and multi-cloud environments, the alert stream evolved into a firehose. While additional dashboards and stricter thresholds enabled teams to respond more quickly, they did not stop recurring problems or decrease the overall noise. The solution was not "more tools." It was a playbook update. That update starts with the basics of clean data, consistent tagging, reliable telemetry, clear ownership, and real SLOs. Once the foundation is in place, apply AIOps where it excels.
