<h3>DevOpsDayLA 2026 Call for Presentations</h3>
<p><strong>Friday, March 6, 2026 | Pasadena Convention Center | 15th Annual Event</strong></p>
<h4>What is DevOpsDayLA?</h4>
<p>
DevOpsDayLA is Southern California's premier conference focused on the human side of technology delivery. For 15 years, we've brought together Southern California practitioners, engineers, and leaders who understand that great software isn't just about tools and automation, it's about people working together effectively.
</p>
<p>
As part of SCaLE (Southern California Linux Expo), DevOpsDayLA differentiates itself by focusing on culture, collaboration, and real-world implementation stories from local industry rather than pure technical deep-dives or vendor pitches.
</p>
<h4>The 2026 DevOps Lens: DevOps in an AI World</h4>
<p>
You're working in a world where AI is everywhere: embedded in your tools, requested by your management, and reshaping how teams deliver software. Whether you're embracing these changes or navigating the challenges they create, your experience matters.
</p>
<p>
DevOpsDayLA 2026 isn't just another Tech conference. We want to hear how practitioners and organizations are adapting their mindsets, processes, and team dynamics in this rapidly evolving landscape.
</p>
<h4>What We're Looking For</h4>
<h5>Primary Focus Areas</h5>
<p><strong>Stories from the Trenches</strong></p>

- How your team successfully integrated AI into existing workflows
- Real implementation challenges and solutions at your organization
- What changed about team collaboration when AI entered the picture
- Lessons learned from AI adoption failures and successes

<p><strong>The Human Element in an AI World</strong></p>

-   When and where humans remain critical in automated workflows
-   New skills teams need beyond traditional DevOps practices
-   How roles and responsibilities are evolving
-   Managing the cultural shift when AI changes daily work
-   Building the next generation of DevOps engineers when entry-level work is automated

<p><strong>Security and Operational Boundaries</strong></p>

-   Securing AI-generated code and AI-provisioned infrastructure
-   Establishing safe boundaries between automated systems
-   New operational challenges with AI in the deployment pipeline

<p><strong>Cross-Industry SoCal Perspectives</strong></p>

-   DevOps practices in local entertainment, gaming, aerospace, retail, healthcare, and manufacturing
-   How Southern California companies are approaching these changes
-   Scaling DevOps culture across LA's diverse industries

<h4>Talk Formats</h4>
<p><strong>Full Talks (30-40 minutes)</strong></p>

-   In-depth case studies and implementation stories
-   Strategic approaches to team and cultural challenges
-   Comprehensive lessons learned from major initiatives
<p><strong>Lightning Talks (10 minutes)</strong></p>

-   Quick wins and practical tips
-   Specific tools or techniques that solved real problems
-   Brief lessons learned or "what we wish we'd known"
<p><strong>Open Spaces (Decided at the Event)</strong></p>

-   Facilitated discussions on topics that emerge from the community
-   Problem-solving sessions for current challenges
-   Networking around shared interests and experiences

<h4>Example Talk Ideas</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"From Code Reviews to AI Oversight: How Our Team Adapted" A practical story about changing team processes when AI joined the development workflow.</p>
<p>"The Infrastructure That Provisions Itself: Lessons from Production" Real-world experience with AI-driven infrastructure automation, including what went wrong.</p>
<p>"Gaming Studios and DevOps: How LA Entertainment Companies Scale Under Pressure" Cross-industry perspective on DevOps practices in Southern California's high-pressure creative environments.</p>
<p>"From Hollywood VFX to Healthcare: DevOps Across SoCal Industries" How different Southern California sectors approach similar operational challenges.</p>
<p>"Scaling DevOps at a SoCal Aerospace Startup" Real-world lessons from growing DevOps culture in traditional aerospace.</p>
<p>"Building the Next Generation: Creating Career Paths When Entry-Level Work is Automated" How organizations are developing junior talent and creating meaningful career progression when AI automates traditional starting roles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>What We DON'T Want</h4>

<p>Better suited for other SCaLE tracks:</p>

-   Pure infrastructure/cloud architecture → Infrastructure Track
-   AI/ML algorithms, model training, and data science → AI Track
-   Kubernetes/Docker technical deep-dives → Cloud Native Track
-   Security tools and vulnerability scanning → Security Track
-   Linux system administration → General/Infrastructure Track
-   Database optimization and management → PostgreSQL Track
-   Pure development practices → Developer Track

<p>We also avoid:</p>

-   Vendor pitches disguised as educational content
-   Tool demonstrations without implementation stories
-   Abstract discussions about AI without practical application
-   Content that repeats previous years without fresh insights
-   Third-party submissions from PR firms or marketing departments. Speakers must be directly engaged with our community-driven event

<h4>Ideal Speakers</h4>

-   <strong>Southern California Practitioners First:</strong> We prioritize people doing the work locally over people selling solutions.
-   <strong>Local Industry Diversity:</strong> We especially encourage speakers from SoCal's gaming, entertainment, aerospace, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and other established industries.
-   <strong>New Local Voices:</strong> You are the only one who can tell your story. We're particularly interested in challenges and successes from our local area and happy to provide speaker coaching for first-time presenters.
-   <strong>Under-represented Perspectives:</strong> We want to hear all voices, including those that may speak less frequently at similar events. Whether you're in a field not typically thought of as technology, you're in a large traditional organization, or you're the only person at your company with your background, we're interested in your unique experience.
-   <strong>All Experience Levels:</strong> Whether you're a seasoned architect at a major studio or someone who just solved their first DevOps challenge at a local startup, we want to hear your story.
-   <strong>SoCal Companies:</strong> We welcome speakers from Los Angeles, Orange County, Inland Empire, and San Diego companies of all sizes.

<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>

-   <strong>Practical Value:</strong> Will attendees leave with something they can apply immediately?
-   <strong>Authentic Experience:</strong> Are you sharing real work and honest lessons learned?
-   <strong>Fresh Perspective:</strong> Does this offer new insights rather than repeating familiar content? We'll consider talks presented elsewhere, but prefer content that our local area hasn't already seen.
-   <strong>Broad Appeal:</strong> How will your talk resonate across different industries and experience levels? Technical deep-dives should provide value for the whole room, including those who might not use your specific tool.
-   <strong>Community Fit:</strong> Does this advance our mission of improving how people work together in technology?

<h4>Speaker Commitment Requirements</h4>

-   <strong>Attendance Confirmation:</strong> We require all accepted speakers to confirm attendance with contact information (including phone number) and agree to our confirmation system to prevent no-shows.
-   <strong>Content Freshness:</strong> Speakers must confirm their talk offers new insights and hasn't been presented at DevOpsDayLA in previous years without significant updates.
-   <strong>Vendor Disclosure:</strong> Clearly indicate if your talk includes vendor content, product demonstrations, or commercial messaging.

<ul>
<li><strong>Write a compelling short abstract.</strong> This appears in print materials and must hook readers immediately. Explain the problem you're solving and why it matters.</li>

<li><strong>Highlight your SoCal connection.</strong> We prioritize local practitioners sharing real experiences from Southern California companies and industries.</li>
<li><strong>Show, don't tell.</strong> Instead of "This talk will cover DevOps best practices," say "When we integrated AI into our deployment pipeline at [Company], we discovered that..."</li>
<li><strong>Make it practical.</strong> Focus on takeaways attendees can apply immediately. What will they learn? What can they do differently on Monday?</li>
