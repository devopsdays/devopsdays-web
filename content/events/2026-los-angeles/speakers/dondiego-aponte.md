<b>Barns Don't Burn Down Because of One Loose Nail, But Yours Just Might</b><br><br>
Kubernetes is exceptionally good at keeping things running—and sometimes a little too good at hiding when they're not. Pods restart, nodes reschedule, alerts auto-resolve, and dashboards stay green long after the system has started misbehaving.
</p>

<p>
In this 10-minute talk, we'll walk through examples of Kubernetes failure patterns where missing observability signals and incomplete instrumentation allow small problems to quietly pile up until they become a production outage. We'll show how infrastructure-heavy dashboards—and "AIOps" systems confidently declaring "this is fine"—create blind spots that delay human intervention.
</p>

<p>
Using OpenTelemetry as a practical example, we'll dig into how to instrument for behavior instead of resources, correlate metrics, logs, and traces by default, and surface early warning signs before users feel the impact.
</p>

<p>
Because barns don't burn down because of one loose nail—but modern production systems absolutely can.
