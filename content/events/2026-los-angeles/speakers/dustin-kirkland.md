<b>Agentic Pipelines for an OS Supply Chain</b><br><br>
Agentic workflows are rapidly becoming the next major shift in software engineering: systems that can plan, act, verify, learn, and repeat—turning “prompting” into production-grade automation. In this talk, I’ll share a practical framework for how developers can adopt agentic workflows responsibly, and why they unlock a new level of leverage for building and operating complex systems.   The goal is simple: help the Linux community build software systems that get better over time—secure by default, and fast by design today.
