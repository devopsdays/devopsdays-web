<b>Building AI Platforms Without Losing Your Engineering Principles</b><br><br>
As organizations adopt generative AI, platform teams must support multi-node inference, GPU-based model serving, and growing API sprawl while keeping the developer experience simple. This session explores Kubernetes-native approaches like kserve, high-throughput frameworks like vLLM, and gateways like LiteLLM for standardized model access. Attendees will learn concrete patterns for supporting AI at scale while preserving the principles that made their platforms successful.
