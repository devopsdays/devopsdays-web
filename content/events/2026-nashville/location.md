This year, we’re doing something a little different. While our name proudly carries “Nashville,” we’re excited to host the event at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) to:
- Partner with higher education and connect students directly with the DevOps community.
- Grow the next generation of engineers and technologists by making DevOpsDays more accessible to students and educators.
- Stay close to Nashville — Murfreesboro is only a short drive away — while providing a beautiful campus setting with the space and resources to make this our best event yet!
