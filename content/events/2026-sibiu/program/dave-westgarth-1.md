This talk explores how AI-powered vibe coding tools are transforming Lean UX and Agile delivery. The session re-examines Lean UX principles and shows how Vibe UX collapses the distance between idea and product, creating radically faster feedback loops and enabling instant experimentation. It covers where this approach shines (and where it backfires), practical safeguards, implications for Agile teams, and how Vibe UX tools let anyone prototype, test, and learn in real time finishing with a practical toolkit and a call to action: start vibing, and amplify both learning and value in your team.
