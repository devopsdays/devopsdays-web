The half-life of skills was already shrinking but the emergence of modern AI has accelerated that change. Frameworks and certifications that once defined a career path have now fallen out of favour and the most valuable skill for learners today is the ability to learn, unlearn, relearn and build adaptive habits that AI can't replace. In this session, we’ll explore how delivery professionals can future-proof themselves by embracing curiosity, building AI fluency, and shifting from knowledge-hoarding to sense-making. We'll cover practical strategies, real-world examples, and a fresh perspective on how curiosity can become your career’s greatest insurance policy.
