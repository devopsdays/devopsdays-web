This workshop equips DevOps engineers with essential best practices for leveraging intellectual property (IP) rights to safeguard innovations in pipelines, infrastructures, and automation tools. Participants will explore copyright for scripts and configurations; patents for new DevOps processes; trade secrets for proprietary platforms, and trademarks for internal tools. Key benefits include preventing ownership disputes with contractors and mitigating open-source license risks in deployments.
