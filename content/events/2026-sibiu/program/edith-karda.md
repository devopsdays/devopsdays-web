Ever wondered how Traefik manages domain magic in the background? We’ll solve the mystery of having multiple domains in one environment, how it can improve cloud platform migrations, and create a seamless user experience for end-users.  Context: Traefik Proxy as an Ingress Controller in Kubernetes.  Based on a real-world migration experience, this case study will walk you through the process of configuring not one, but three domains with a single IP!  It also improved our overall infrastructure in multiple ways, reducing resources being only one of them.  Curious about another scenario?  Find out how two domains can happily live together in a cluster, but be completely independent, each having their separate IP and microservices.  This session is perfect for anyone curious to dive into Traefik’s capabilities and discover different uses of multi-domain setups.
