Cloudy with a Chance of Dynamic Pricing: Building a Weather Driven IoT System with Raspberry Pi What if the weather could change your prices in real time?  In this session, we connect a Raspberry Pi to a live Weather API and turn temperature, rain and sunlight into dynamic pricing logic. You will see how a small IoT device can fetch external data, process it locally, and display a price that shifts with the forecast.  We walk through the full flow: integrating the API, handling data securely, designing simple pricing rules, and displaying the result on a physical interface. Along the way, we explore DevOps practices for IoT projects, including automation, environment management and secure configuration.  This talk brings together cloud services, edge devices and real world logic in a practical demo that shows how weather data can drive business decisions in real time.
