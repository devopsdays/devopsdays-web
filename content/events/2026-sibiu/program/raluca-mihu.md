+++

DevOps engineers operate in high responsibility environments where uptime, security and delivery speed meet constant change. Sustainable performance begins with a resilient nervous system.  In this interactive session, Raluca Mihu introduces practical mental health tools designed for engineers. Together, we will practise guided breathing techniques to regulate stress, short mindfulness exercises to sharpen focus, and EFT tapping to release tension before it escalates. Each method is simple, evidence informed and easy to integrate into a busy workday.  This session offers more than awareness. It offers direct experience. You will leave with concrete tools that support clarity during incidents, steadiness during pressure and long term energy for meaningful work. DevOps culture thrives on continuous improvement, and that includes the human system behind the keyboard.
