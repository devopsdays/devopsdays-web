I’m an independent DevOps and platform consultant working with teams across Europe. I help organizations run reliable, cost-aware systems and untangle messy operational realities around cloud, platforms, and team ownership. My work is hands-on and pragmatic, usually in environments where “best practices” collide with real constraints.
