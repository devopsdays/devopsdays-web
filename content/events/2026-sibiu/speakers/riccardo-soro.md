I am a computer engineer deeply passionate about computer science, particularly in the areas of DevOps and generative AI. My journey in the tech world is fueled by relentless curiosity and a strong drive for innovation. In my free time, I never miss the chance to go rock climbing with friends, where I find inspiration and fresh ideas among the cliffs. My thirst for knowledge and determination constantly propel me to explore new technological frontiers and tackle every challenge with enthusiasm.
