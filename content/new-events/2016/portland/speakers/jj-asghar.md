JJ is a Sr. Partner Engineer at Chef, he was also the PTL for the Openstack-Chef project. He lives in Austin, Texas and has been part of the OpenStack community since Diablo's release.

 He enjoys a good strong stout, hoppy IPA, and some Dwarf Fortress. He's a member of the Church of Emacs, and usually chooses Ubuntu over CentOS.

 He's a father and husband, if he's not trying to automate his job away he's trying to convince his daughters to "let the bot's do the work for them."
