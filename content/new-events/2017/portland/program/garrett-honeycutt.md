Discuss how layering control repos for configuration management can
improve collaboration between teams. Allow different teams to focus on
the config management that they care about, while using others code.
Will show an example with Puppet, though this idea is universal to all
CM tooling.

Show [Rizzo](https://github.com/ghoneycutt/rizzo), a tool that allows
working with layered control repos with Puppet and Vagrant easier.
