I'm coder at heart, has been coding for 13 years. Currently I assume Development Manager role at Blibli.com, it is basically an Engineering Manager role. One of my role is setting up Mobile Apps team and helping them doing continuous deployment. 

I've been interested in DevOps since long time, discussing continuous delovery inside blibli.com since 2012, but only recently we picking up DevOps culture as part of our daily operation.
