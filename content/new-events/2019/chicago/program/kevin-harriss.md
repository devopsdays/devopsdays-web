The story of how a Chicago finance company avoided a radical shift and took a more evolutionary approach to its DevOps transformation. I will share the lessons we learned along the way to hopefully ease your DevOps transformation.

A lot of the talks about DevOps transformations take a "big bang" approach requiring a radical culture change. This talk will tell the story of how a local financial company has taken an evolutionary approach to its DevOps transformation. There were lots of trials, tribulations, false starts and successes along our journey. I will share examples of actions that worked well for us as well as actions that didn't work so well. Hopefully these stories will help ease your DevOps transformation.
