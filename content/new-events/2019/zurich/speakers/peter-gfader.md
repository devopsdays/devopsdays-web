Peter Gfader works as trainer and technical agile coach, where he helps people, teams, and
organizations to build and deliver exciting products. The drive for improvement (and the
smell of coffee) gets him out of bed in the morning. Peter is on a journey to make
everyone happy. If he isn’t riding a mountain bike or playing the trumpet, you might find
him at a local user group, hanging out with other nerds!
