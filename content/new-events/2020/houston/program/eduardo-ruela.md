In this hands on session, I will show how we are using Jenkins X, Tekton, GKE and Terraform to build infrastructure as code and create CICD pipelines to build and deploy business applications in this infrastructure. We will show how we are giving the development teams autonomy to build infrastructure to deploy their applications and at the same time ensure that this infrastructure follow company standards and are compliant with security requirements.
