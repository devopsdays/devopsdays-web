We’ve spent six years studying secure coding practices of DevOps and Continuous Delivery organizations by surveying over 15,000 IT professionals. We’ve analyzed their staffing practices, educational priorities, automation choices, and process improvements that improve their cybersecurity preparedness. Our study has also uncovered details of where automation fails, awareness falls short and breaches happen.

Come participate in this session where we will share the 10 habits practiced by the DevSecOps Elite that you can then apply to – or further mature within – your own organization. We will also uncover what our analysis revealed about securing CI/CD pipelines, including what popular Jenkins plug-ins are used for security.
