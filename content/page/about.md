Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area. 

Most devopsdays events feature a combination of curated talks (see open [Calls for Proposals](/speaking/)) and self organized [open space](/open-space-format/) content. Topics often include automation, testing, security, and organizational culture.

### History

The first devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. Since then, devopsdays events have multiplied, and if there isn't one in your city, [check out the information](/organizing/) about organizing one yourself!
