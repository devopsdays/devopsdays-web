+++

Respect and empathy are core devops values. Devopsdays is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone in the devops community can learn and share in respectful, considerate collaboration.

Every devopsdays event has a code of conduct, and we expect the organizer community before, during, and after the conferences to follow a similar code of conduct.

Devopsdays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every participant, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment of anyone in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any devopsdays venue, including Slack, GitHub, and email. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the organization at the discretion of the core organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please [contact a member of core organizers](http://www.devopsdays.org/contact/) immediately.
