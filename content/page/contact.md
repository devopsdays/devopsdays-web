Organization is decentralized. Local events handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other organization. For questions about a specific event you see listed on the site, contact the local organizers for that event; their email is on their contact page.

The devopsdays global core team guides local organizers in hosting their own devopsdays events worldwide.

If you have questions about hosting your own event or about potential future events you don't see listed, [email the core organizers](mailto:info@devopsdays.org). The core organizers cannot answer questions about sponsorships or registration for individual cities.
