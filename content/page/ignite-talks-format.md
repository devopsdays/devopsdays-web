If you have a strong devops-related message that you really want to share with the DevOps world, we encourage you to send us a proposal for an Ignite presentation.

These are 5 minute talks with 20 slides which auto-advance. If you aren't familiar with the format, good examples can be found at [http://igniteshow.com/](http://igniteshow.com)

Tell us about tools, processes, tips, tricks, war stories, whatever... make us laugh, make us cry, show us how to be more awesome...

The only rule is don't give a straight sales pitch. That's not even a rule we'll enforce, everyone will just think you are uncool... that is punishment enough.
