Most devopsdays events are a combination of curated talks and self organized conversations. The self organized content is known as "open spaces". Open Spaces give attendees the opportunity to talk about anything they'd like. A person might suggest a topic they want to learn about, or one they feel like they can help others with. The topics range widely, from highly technical, to pure culture, to board games for networking.

<div><em>Open space is the simplest meeting format that could possibly work.</em>
<em> </em></div>
<em> It is based on (un)common sense of what people do naturally in productive meetings.</em>

Principles (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Wikipedia on Open_Space_Technology</a>):
<blockquote>While  the mechanics of Open Space provide a simple means to self-organize, it  is the underlying principles that make it effective both for meetings  and as a guidepost for individual and collective effectiveness.

The  Law of Two Feet — a foot of passion and a foot of responsibility —  expresses the core idea of taking responsibility for what you love. In  practical terms, the law says that if you’re neither contributing nor  getting value where you are, use your two feet (or available form of  mobility) and go somewhere where you can. It is also a reminder to stand  up for your passion.

From the law flow four principles:
<ul>
	<li>Whoever comes is the right people</li>
	<li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
	<li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
	<li>When it’s over, it’s over</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The open space rallying cry is:

<strong>Open Space Mechanics</strong>

Since the meeting is supposed to be self-organizing, the conveners put their energy <em>not in running the meeting</em> but creating a setting that gets everyone’s creative energy flowing.

<strong>Opening</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Show the timeline, how the event breaks down into Opening, Marketplace of ideas, Break-out sessions, Closing.</li>
	<li>Sponsor  introduces the theme. Briefly. One or two minutes max. Long openings  drain the energy of the meeting quickly. Get participants to work ASAP.</li>
	<li>Facilitators introduce the principles and the format. Explain how the marketplace of ideas works.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Marketplace of ideas</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Participants write ‘issues’ on pieces of paper. Preferably with bold markers, so they are easy to read from a distance.</li>
	<li>Participants choose a timeslot for their topic on the agenda wall.</li>
	<li>One by one, participants explain their issue to the others, with the aim of drawing the right people to their break-out-session.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Break-out sessions</strong>:
Once people do not come up with new issues (wait a little bit, and ask  ‘are we done?’. I find the silence that often happens at the beginning  and end of the marketplace the scariest. However, this silence seems to  be very productive.

You may ask people to put their name on sessions they want to attend. More than one session per slot is OK… (law of two feet  <img src="/img/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /> ). This gives conveners an idea of how busy their session is going to  be. It gives participants an image of how the break-out session is  going.

People may shuffle sessions around, or merge  sessions as they are deciding where to go. Have a wiki where people can  record outcomes of sessions, or provide paper forms for note-taking  during sessions (recording who attended, a summary of the session and  outcomes/questions for further work) that you can collect into a ‘book  of proceedings’.

The facilitators’ role in this bit  of the conference is to answer questions, and make sure everyone has the  materials they need to run their break-out session. They do not (in  principle) intervene in the sessions - the participants are supposed to  self-organize.

<strong>Closing:</strong>
Have  everyone back in the circle. A simple and effective way to close is to  have the participants pass a ‘talking stick’ around, and let them  (briefly, e.g. in a sentence or a word) say what they feel about the  day.

<strong>Bumblebees and butterflies</strong>:
<strong>Bumblebees </strong>internalize  the law of two feet quickly, and constantly flit from meeting to  meeting, pollinating, cross-fertilizing, and adding richness and  variety.

<strong>Butterflies </strong>may never get into any  meeting. They are focal points of quiet and beauty. If you watch them,  every once in a while you'll see them engage in conversation. Those  conversations often are significant.
