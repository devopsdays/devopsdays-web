I began writing programs, and by the age of 10, I knew what I wanted to do when I “grew up” without understanding how computers and technology would influence our world in the future. <br><br>Fast forward to present times, and we live in a digitally connected world. Innovations have improved business and personal technology while increasing productivity. Unfortunately, this has also lead to opportunities for, and an increase in, cyber threats. According to a 2013 report, over 552 million identities were exposed via breaches, and there was a 62% increase in the number of breaches over the previous year. <br><br>As a 16-year experienced Information Security professional, I have helped businesses counter threats. I have assessed applications for security risks, and implemented security controls. Having also been a software engineer, in an earlier part of my career, as well as still writing code for fun and the challenges, my focus on application security is a natural place for me to practice, and has become my passion. <br><br>In recent years, I’ve become involved with, and very interested in, DevOps/DevSecOps. This way of software delivery has me looking for ways to improve processes, while still ensuring that teams are delivering secure software."
