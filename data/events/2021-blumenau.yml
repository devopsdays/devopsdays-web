# In this section, list the level of sponsorships and the label to use.
# You may optionally include a "max" attribute to limit the number of sponsors per level. For
# unlimited sponsors, omit the max attribute or set it to 0. If you want to prevent all
# sponsorship for a specific level, it is best to remove the level.
