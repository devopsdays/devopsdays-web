Since I turned to the dark side by going into management, I live vicariously through other engineers and have fond memories of spending my time in code and command lines rather than Outlook and Excel. I'm active in the DevOps community with DevOpsDays DC and as an advisor to IT Revolution. I have a passion for how technology can be used to help organizations win with their mission and people find joy in their work."
