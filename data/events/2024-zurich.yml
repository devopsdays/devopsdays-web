Unfortunately, at the end, customers and users were often not very satisfied with the solutions delivered! Therefore, I was definitely thrilled, when I came across the Scrum method in the early 90s and further, when I read beginning of 2010 several articles about the DevOps and SAFe. For me, these methodologies and principles closed the last methodology gaps within the entire software life cycle! Since over ten years now, I have successfully managed various medium and large DevOps-oriented software development projects as well as transformations of organizations into the agile world. In my current role as an “Independent Consultant” I am supporting and coaching Swiss customers in the transformation of their project and ICT organizations into the agile and DevOps-oriented world.</p>"
