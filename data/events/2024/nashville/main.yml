    bio: "Don Bauer started his career fourteen years ago in a metrics analyst and systems engineering role with Charter Communications. Since then, he has held roles in development, infrastructure, architecture and operations for both enterprise corporations and startups. He immediately recognized a common thread in each role that allowed him to focus on enabling teams and companies to succeed through standardization, simplification, and automation. Don believes companies and teams succeed through transparency and experimentation without the fear of failure. In his current role, Don operates with one simple principle: to automate himself out of a job. Currently, Don is the Director of DevOps Engineering at IHS Markit. He primarily focuses on automating the integration and delivery of software and services, and he supports innovation using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Don is also a Docker captain and community leader and organizes several local meetups."
