    bio: "I've been working in Software Development for more than 15 years. I prefer medium-size companies with medium-size projects and relative fast feedback loop. I've started organizing Prague DevOps meetup many years ago. It has helped me to meet and get to know a lot of companies, people and technologies that are DevOps-oriented. I'm currently learning how to be a good parent, which is costing me a lot of time, but I would like to keep in touch with communities and people with free mind."
