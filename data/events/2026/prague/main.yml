    bio: "I've been working in Software Development for more than 15 years. I prefer medium-size companies with medium-size projects and relative fast feedback loop. I've started organizing Prague DevOps meetup many years ago. It has helped me to meet and get to know a lot of companies, people and technologies that are DevOps-oriented. I'm currently learning how to be a good parent, which is costing me a lot of time, but I would like to keep in touch with communities and people with free mind."

  - name: "Dan Yelovitch"
    bio: "With over 15 years in software development, I’ve evolved into a DevOps-focused Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) passionate about bridging development and operations through self-service tooling that empowers teams to own their workflows. Whether collaborating with startups or enterprises, I thrive on building scalable, developer-centric platforms that embed operational visibility directly into the dev experience, fostering a culture of shared responsibility. What fuels me most is DevOps’ relentless innovation—a space where curiosity and cutting-edge tools converge to solve real-world challenges, transforming not just how we deploy code, but how teams collaborate, learn, and reimagine what's possible in our ever-evolving tech landscape."
