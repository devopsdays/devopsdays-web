bio: "While culture and sharing are at the heart of DevOps, Infrastructure Automation is the technical backbone. That’s one of the reasons why Hannah co-founded Pendrica, a consultancy specialising in Platform Automation with Chef and Microsoft. Hannah’s background and experience in managing large scale software programmes naturally lead to a keen interest in Agile, Continuous Delivery and the DevOps movement as a way of building collaborative, highly-performing teams. As a coach and mentor she continues this work today, helping teams improve how they work together in the fast-moving world of automation. Outside of work you can generally find Hannah in her local pub enjoying a craft beer while planning her next adventure."
