bio: "As a software engineer at Chef, Victoria has developed on Delivery and Compliance, spending her days in her code cave battling whatever dragons come her way.  Prior to joining Chef, she was an assistant teacher at her son’s school, where she spent her days getting dirty in gardens and playing games.  When she’s not hiding out in her code cave, you can find her hanging with family, admiring the baby lizards in the backyard, and wishing she had a koala pet."
