bio: "My name is Blerim Sheqa and I work as Senior Systems Engineer at NETWAYS. In the Managed Services department I am responsible for an infrastructure that hosts multiple customer setups. In the last couple of years I spent my time on creating a fully monitored environment by using Open Source tools like Icinga2, Puppet, Graphite and Logstash.  Starting from now I will support the Icinga Team in the matter of implementation of interfaces and managing technical partnerships."
