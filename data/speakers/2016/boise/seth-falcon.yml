         A product focused engineering leader who builds teams that consistently
         deliver valuable, high quality software at velocity.

         Seth believes the essential elements for a high performing team are
         trust, commitment to learning and experimentation, mechanisms for
         measuring outcomes, and clear communication. He's helped teams increase
         their effectiveness as an individual contributor, an engineering
         manager, and as a leader of managers.
