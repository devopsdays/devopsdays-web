         the strategy for attracting, hiring, retaining, and developing top
         technical talent.  Trish’s passion for cultivating technical talent has
         led her to collaborate with outside organizations such as St. Mary’s

         Northern California to design and deliver pertinent technical classes
         and programs for in-demand technical skills. She originally joined

         variety of roles that have consistently focused on aligning people,
         strategies and programs to business objectives. Prior to moving to the
         Bay Area in 1998, Trish worked in Social Services and held
         administrative roles in New York City.  She earned her B.A. in
         Psychology from Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York
