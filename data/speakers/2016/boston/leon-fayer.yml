bio: Leon's two decades of expertise were concentrated on architecting and operating
  complex, web-based systems to withstand crushing traffic (often unexpectedly). Over
  the years, he's had a somewhat unique opportunity to design and build systems that
  run some of the most visited websites in the world. While his core expertise is
  in application development, he works his way around the whole technology stack from
  system architecture to databases design and optimization to front/back-end programming.
  He's considered a professional naysayer by peers and has the opinion that nothing
  really works until it works for at least a million people. In his current role Leon
  advises companies about critical aspects of project strategies and and concentrates
  on educating others by writing and speaking about industry trends and best practices,
  sharing his experience as related to designing and operating architectures at scale.
