bio: 'I''m a DevOps Engineer, and I''m happiest when spawning invisible computers
  in "the cloud."  I started out in the tech field in 2007 when I attended my first
  web development meetup in Providence and learned what "WYSIWYG" meant.  Nowadays
  you can find me at DevOps meetups or hanging around in the Seaport district. '
