Marissa prides herself on being a “cool nerd” who likes to get her hands in everything. When she decided she wanted to learn to decorate cakes, instead of taking classes she let the internet be her guide. She made one cake a week for an entire year chronicling the experience on 52cakes.com. She is also an accomplished singer/songwriter who has released three albums and shared the stage with talented musicians such as Matt Nathanson, Lisa Loeb and Gavin DeGraw. She has also participated in the 2012 StartupBus and was on the winning team of the 2012 International Space Apps Challenge. She is passionate about mentorship, especially for women in tech. In addition to teaching programing at the School of Visual Arts she is also a regular panelist at Pace Path Live and recently mentored Girl Scouts at a SXSW event sponsored by Twitter and Dove."
