bio: "I started my career working for the water company (De Watergroep) for 2 years. But I decided I wanted to make an impact on the company I worked for. And that’s why I started working for an independent web developer. My love for helping clients developed there, but I still felt that I needed to work for a company that is willing to go the extra mile. And now I found it at Openminds, a pure and amazing DevOps-company.

When I’m not at work, you can find me on a muddy outdoor football pitch or indoor football court somewhere in Oost-Vlaanderen. I thought I was a gadget freak but when you start to work at an IT company, you realise you’re not even average :)
