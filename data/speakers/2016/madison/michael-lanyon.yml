bio: "Hi. I’m Mike. I’m a VP of Engineering at Critical Mass. In my role at CM I lead teams that work on the systems and data that power customer experiences. I started as our first application developer in the United States, and after my first “worked fine in dev” experience, have been trying to make delivering value to our clients’ customers as routine and predictable as possible. Automation, measurement, and team building are my passions.

Outside of work I’m a competitive cyclist and a DevOpsDays Chicago organizer. I was first introduced to DevOps back in 2011 and had my mind blown by a few luminaries of the DevOps movement. I find the passion and enthusiasm for iterative improvement in technology absolutely irresistible."
