bio: "AJ Bowen is on a mission to containerize all the things and help others to do the same. In the past, AJ has done technical support, evangelism, and customer and developer advocacy at Gandi. Her other experience includes heavy involvement in the Occupy movement in Kansas City, where she discovered the delightful and complicated world of horizontal organization in groups of passionate people with wildly diverse political perspectives, and humanitarian work in Haiti. AJ doesn’t like being told what to do—or telling others what to do—and is on a constant mission to eliminate unnecessary hierarchy."
