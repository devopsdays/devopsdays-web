bio: "Dana Engebretson and Python are like synchronized swimmers in a sea of data. She is a data scientist building classification models for BI Worldwide, which somehow led to lots of devops-related fun too. Dana founded PyLadies Twin Cities, our local nest of Python women and allies. She enjoys mentoring and thinking about universal design."
