bio: "Tracey is an incoming junior currently at Rosemount High School. She has been able to pursue her interest in Computer Science through mentoring in CoderDojo with Scratch, AppInventor, Web Development, and Finch Robots. Last year, she and her partner were Regional Winners for the Technovation Challenge with their app, AbroadNet, which helps bridge the gap between foreign exchange and local students. Because of these opportunities, Tracey has learned just as much from the younger students she mentored, as any strong teacher would. She is interested in pursuing a computer science career in the future."
