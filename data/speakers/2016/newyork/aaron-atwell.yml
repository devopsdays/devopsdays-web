bio: "Aaron is part of the team at VictorOps that is working to connect IT teams to
a product that makes them more effective and helps make their 'on-call lives
suck less' After spending 'many' years in the staffing industry helping put
people to work, he's found a new adventure in helping IT teams be more
effective by improving communication, increasing visibility of infrastructure
issues, and helping teams get their product to their stakeholders, faster.
He's also interested in the positive and negative effects technology has on IT
professional's daily lives. When he's not working you'll find him on his
mountain bike exploring Colorado's trails, hanging out with family, and
volunteering to help and support people in need in the Boulder community. He's
encouraging everyone to love more."
