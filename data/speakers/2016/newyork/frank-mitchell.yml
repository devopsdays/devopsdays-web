bio: "Frank Mitchell is a Senior Software Engineer at Rapid7. He’s been
crisscrossing the DevOps Divide for the past ten years searching for that
mythic place in the middle where code flows freely and conversations are super
constructive. Along the way he’s helped build CAD engines, video game
platforms, and open source security solutions. Frank believes shipping
software is a skill, marketing isn’t an afterthought, and ice cream exists to
be eaten."
