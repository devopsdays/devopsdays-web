bio: "I'm Alex. I spent a portion of time in the Army. Then I left to do CompSci at Auckland University. I did an internship at Spark Ventures and now work for Healthlink. My background is in web applications with node and java. More and more I find myself drawn to a mixture of applications and infrastructure. I think Pilsner is superior to IPA and that Guinness is best served at room temperature. If I'm drinking a loaf of bread, that bread ought to be warm."
