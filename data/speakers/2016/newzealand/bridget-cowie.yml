bio: "I'm the person you call when performance outages get really bad. I work with teams to identify and resolve issues with their production applications both in production environments and also in development & test. I'm happiest when we detect problems as early as possible and I hope that I can work myself out of a job! To sum it up - I love performance, technology & automation (and talking)."
