bio: "Owen is a developers' developer. Someone who hates being pigeon-holed while writing his own bio. He is currently helping out 8i by leading their platform development, which involves being all things to all people in the business. He likes to get his hands dirty with AWS and Containerisation as well as leading highly productive engineering teams. Before 8i Owen founded and ran a developer startup focusing on one of the first 'serverless' computing platforms, hoist.io. And previously, he helped grow Xero from a company of 20 to 500 when he left as their Chief Architect."
