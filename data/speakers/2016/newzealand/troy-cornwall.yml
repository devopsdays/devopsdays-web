bio: "Currently a Software Developer in the Health Industry.
Fighting to help make the right technology choices, in a industry which is resistant to change. I started programming in High School. During my second year of Uni, I worked at a start up, Active Mobile Security, helping write a Automation Testing Framework to test an Android Security Platform. When funding fell thru for AMS, I moved to Spark Ventures, and built the CI/CD platform for Bigpipe, as well as internal tooling for Lightbox. Now at HealthLink reworking the way developers here work, using all the buzz word technologies, focusing on increasing the quality of our products, and the speed to market."
