bio: "Anders has been working as an developer, architect, team-lead and automation nut for the last 12 years. He's a big proponent off most things agile and think it's time IT started enabling organisations to change. Not limiting the organisation.<br/><br/> Anders is a tech guy and programmer first. The last 4-years he has been trying to automate anything that is needed to deploy applications reliably. Learning (a little too much) Bash and Python along the way.<br><br> [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/anderssv)"
