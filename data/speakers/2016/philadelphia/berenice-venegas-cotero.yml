bio: "A physicist that once fell to the stars of Astrophysics.\n\nHowever, being experimentalist and theoretician at heart, her love eventually fell for molecular Biophysics,\nresearching the cooperative but elusive behavior of lipids\ndesigned nanoliposomes for targeted drug delivery.\n\nHer first close encounter with a computer\nwas a PRIME 750, exclusively used\nto scare mother, who run batch jobs\nfilling her terminal screen with infinite error messages and warnings.\n\nAs a good physicist,\nonly UNIX style computing was acceptable.\nUnfortunately learned some Windows\nwell into the new millennium\nwhich then regretted quite a bit.\n\n\nResearch brought dynamic and Monte Carlo simulations,\nexperimental data required analysis automation\nso cloud computing offered attractive adventures\nBig data IoT pipelines dockerization Oh My!\n\nDevOps has become her fascinating playground.\nFeeling infinite compute power at the fingertips,\nshe automates infrastructure up from the ground\nnever having a particular server relationship\n\nBesides obvious interest of maxing out cloud resources\nshe likes unplanned travels and being outdoors\ngymnastics, including mind ones\nand collecting fine peppers for cooking.\n\nIn free time she likes rescuing any pet\nespecially ones being a 'poor thing'."
