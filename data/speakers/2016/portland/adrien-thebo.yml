bio: "Adrien is a software engineer at Puppet. He started in IT Ops in 2005 and started writing code to automate everything, inadvertently becoming one of the earliest devops hipsters (he did devops before it was cool). Adrien joined Puppet in 2011, first on the Operations team where he helped cause frequent outages, and then transferred to the Engineering team in 2013 to where he helped break the build. The original author of r10k and other client tools for Puppet, these days Adrien works on the security development team yelling at openssl documentation and refining ways to protect systems and infrastructure."
