bio: "Ben is a security engineer at Etsy where he protects the yarn from evil doers. He's previously been an operations engineer (or sysadmin to those who've been in the industry more than 10 years) at Puppet Labs working on automation software, a network engineer so knows how to battle through Cisco's product catalogue. He learnt about systems security by the generosity of other people's insecure systems in the 90s."
