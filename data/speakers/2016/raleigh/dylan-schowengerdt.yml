bio: "Dylan wants to live in a world where common sense is a little more common, noise pollution is self-regulated and all dogs get along at the dog park.
 
As an Operations Professional with almost 10 years of experience, he’s worked for global corporations, tech start-ups and everything in-between keeping business units organized, documented and fun.
 
When he’s not creating unique customer solutions or designing reports that don’t bore the executive team to death, you can find him trying new recipes in the kitchen, painting in his studio and spending as much time as possible in the Great Outdoors."
