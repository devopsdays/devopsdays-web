Based on feedback from Harm Boertien I wanted to submit a similar talk to one that I did at the CloudStack Collab conference: DudeOps - Why The Big Lebowski is About Building a Cloud.

Proposed title: DudeOps - Why The Big Lebowski is About Your IT Project 

In this off colored talk, I'll cover the major players of cult favorite The Big Lebowski and how those players map to the people you are likely to encounter when executing an IT project. Successful IT projects are often more about the organizational issues you'll encounter rather than the technical issues. In this talk, we'll cover some of the "characters" of IT you will encounter on your journey, and how to overcome them. For fun, we will draw from the characters of The Big Lebowski, as well as the Dude's experiences, in order to help you navigate your organization.

After all, "All the Dude ever wanted was his project done."

The big change I would make is to go a bit deeper into the characters of IT (based on feedback I got after CloudStack Collab) and incorporate more theory regarding psychology, organizational management, and sociology to educate the audience on organization dynamics. As IT people often lack interpersonal relationship skills (I know I do at times), I think this talk can be very useful for attendees.

The audience was small 15-20 attendees, so the content would still be fresh for the DevOps Amsterdam audience.
