   I'm currently in progress of building a Minimal Viable CI product (MVP), which is completely open-source (https://github.com/pvdissel/cy.io/). It's name is still temporary. The idea is to have the MVP demoable during the open-space. But even if it's not demoable, my focus of this open-space is gathering input on experiences and ideas from the attendees from different kind of backgrounds. Topics I want to discuss are for example:
 - pain-points people face with current CI tools
 - CI tool must-haves
 - How should a CI tool work within the network/cloud? eg. preferences on distributed architectures, used protocols, firewall issues, security related requirements

Speaker:

Patrick van Dissel, Software Engineer working at Tricode in The Netherlands. I've been setting-up, maintaining and improving the continuous integration/delivery pipeline from the technical side for the last 2 years now. During this time I've been looking at all kinds of aspects to get better code and get it to production faster.

It boils down to:
I came to the conclusion that I'm not happy with the existing so called 'Continuous Integration' tools like Hudson/Jenkins, Go, TeamCity, AntHill, TravisCI, etc. They get the job done, but they don't follow the principles of this age, like:
- Configuration-as-Code
- Infrastructure-as-Code
- Keep It Simple Stupid
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Single Responsibility Principle
I've investigated if I could help improve the existing tools to up-to-date. But at a code level it just looked not doable.

So, in my free time, I started my own CI tool project. You can read the specifics at:

With continuous integration, continuous deployment and packaging systems that just install all the latest shiny for us, we don't need to worry about releases any more..do we?

Release engineering is an important aspect of any projects development and deployment cycle. From testing to building, packaging and releasing,  a version number is not just an arbitrary string and relying on one person to understand how your product makes it to customers is a recipe for disaster.

Walk this way and we'll explore methodologies and tooling for managing releases and solutions to common problems such as:


Documenting builds and release processes for both devs and ops.
Understanding when to automate..and when not.
Dependency tracking and avoiding stale dependencies or security issues without breaking builds.

Trust is essential in a successful DevOps environment. But it&rsquo;s generally something established directly between individuals over time, and thus is hard to scale to larger teams and organisations.

We commonly think about DevOps practices such as automation, testing, metrics and continuous integration/delivery in terms of their technical benefits. However, the practices, tools and culture of DevOps are often, at their core, about how to scale trust past individuals by extending visibility to other teams, as well as the wider business.

This talk will provide some recipes for building trust in DevOps, by examining how trust (and lack of it) affects DevOps teams, and how concentrating on this can help you sell DevOps in your organisation.

Building and testing distributed software platforms can be a tedious and daunting task. Achieving good coverage can be very hard since a lot of factors affect the overall testability and coverage of a system.  Some problems only become apparent on a distributed setup, such as timing and network issues, etc. In this session we&rsquo;ll explain how we used OpenStack and Cloudify to implement and automate real integration testing (as in, no mocks) for our entire product suite, and how we significantly improved our overall coverage and reliability.

Many organisations want to shorten their time-to-market. By
implementing agile they try to shorten the delivery time. Agile
projects use practices like continuous integration, automated
deployment, (acceptance) test-driven development and regression
test automation to get to continuous delivery. In this process build,
integration, test, and deployment automation plays an important role.

The delivery of software has to become fast and reliable. But what
does it take to get to continuous delivery? What are the testing
challenges we face in a continuous delivery? Which test strategies can
we apply be able to test continuous delivery?

This talk zooms in on fully automated testing and a high degree
of automation in the business facing testing to get to continuous
delivery. It focusses on solutions (tooling) within a continuous
delivery model from a testing perspective. It gives the participants
insights in the use of requirements management tooling, test
solutions built with tooling like Selenium and Fitnesse, JMeter,
Appdynamics and other tooling. How can deployment processes
be implemented with the use of the right (often lightweight)
tooling? Which test strategy fits in this process and how to organize
collaboration between developers, testers and operations?

Finally this talk gives practical examples of projects were these
solutions were used.

Recently an overloaded 25 person Devops team supporting a large bank in the Netherlands found they could achieve a better level of support with less than 14 people using Scrum. Achieving this level of performance consistently requires more than just implementing Scrum by the book. Over the past four years, the Scrum Patterns community has created a small pattern language that can enable every Scrum team to achieve extraordinary results. This talk will discuss patterns of implementation that should be adopted by every Devops Scrum.

Given the sysadmin stereotype, it's sometimes easy to forget that not everyone is up at 3am and ready to respond to alerts on a Friday night. In all but the most critical high availability environments, most teams will not have someone actively monitoring graphs 24/7. This means you have to deal with on-call schedules, technical handoffs, documentation, procedure manuals and trying to ensure mistakes aren't made, even in the middle of the night.

This talk will look at how to approach the social aspects of running an ops team in terms of the human impact as well as using automation and tools.

After years of talking about agile as a methodology we are now seeing the fruits of our labor throughout our places of work. We have automated our systems and by tying them together we are now able to develop and deliver software at a frequent and sustainable pace. Tester have mastered the skills to automate their work. Continuous integration servers are doing their best to decide whether the software is 'red' or 'green' and operations is no longer a place where we dump our support tickets.

Still software is not continuously flowing to production. The problems even tend to get bigger when software is dependent on other software. In this presentation I want to share our vision that one of the big reasons for this lack of flow lies within collaboration, and that the next big challenge in agile, deals with culture and how we cooperate in these automated environments that we have now created.

Large and mostly early Scrum implementations in a very revolutionary big bang fashion have taught us that not every organization is fit for a fast change in way of working. We talk about culture, tooling, we hear Agile but which methodology are we going to use? Scrum, Lean, Agile, KanBan? KanBan seams the natural fit for DevOps.

Small incremental changes that help you to get closer to your objective are a very effective way to lower resistance when transitioning to DevOps. With business and Ops usually furthest away from each other and business asking to 'just fix the problem' there can be a big gap. Bridging this gap is a long process where past solutions usually don't work. Context is king.

In this talk I wil share how Kanban can be used as a catalyst for change in culture and behaviour in the whole organization involved in the transition to DevOps and how it can help focus on fixing the problems that need fixing most to achieve your goal.

Honsh&#363;, or Honshuu, is the largest island of Japan.
It is also the codename for the complete rewrite of Server Density that has been over a year in the making, embracing a service orientated architecture similar to those popularised by Amazon and Netflix.
At the heart of Honshuu is the idea that every service is an island. Any island can talk to another, using strict traditions and customs, and almost any island can communicate freely with the wider world via intermediaries and guardians of custom.

Each island is the main land, looking after it's own concerns, only caring that other islands can communicate with it, but not what goes on outside.
This is a cultural shift away from other ways of working more than technological. Knowing when to spin out a new 'island' and making sure it can be communicated with in the same fashion as it's neighbours, from common build strategies regardless of base technology, to involving ops as a guiding principle from the very first steps as to how an island should be built.

The hand-waving blurb: Cloud technology and automated configuration has freed us from the Iron Age of IT infrastructure, and led us into the Cloud Era. Our infrastructure is no longer tightly shackled to physical hardware, but has become fluid data and code, which allows us to apply tools and practices from software development to IT operations.

Many or most of the people at DevOpsDays have been doing this stuff for a while. Although we hear about many common approaches and techniques, I believe it would be useful to describe and share these ideas in a way that makes it easier to talk about them, compare experiences, and introduce good ideas to people who are looking to get into this stuff.

I'll describe some basic anti-patterns and evolutions to better patterns, starting with the old ways of building servers by hand with checklists, to cloning new servers from existing ones (remember Ghost?), to more modern uses of automated configuration management tools such as Cfengine, Puppet, and Chef. I'll also talk about more advanced patterns used by the likes of Netflix, such as Phoenix servers and immutable servers.

There are multiple views on DevOps - a philosophy of more collaborative and productive relationship between development teams and operations teams, a set of integrated release and deployment processes and recently a suite of automation tools due to the strong push from tool vendors. Whatever view you adopt one area is clearly ignored by today&rsquo;s DevOps proponents and adopters. Continuous handling of a highly dynamic changes stream across numerous complex environments and various teams requires a detailed knowledge of what happened, happens and will happen in these environments.

These session will speak about the specific gaps of DevOps caused by the lack of visibility into related IT processes and IT environments.

The cloud gives organizations the ability to develop and run applications with speed and flexibility like never before. Working with an infrastructure that can be 100% API driven enables businesses to use lean methodologies and realize these benefits. However, developers also need to think about the operational tasks needed to keep applications running smoothly. The speed of cloud computing makes getting your code onto the servers and in the proper configuration essential, especially if changes are required in multiple places. Without automation, at scale these routine operational tasks can become time consuming and error-prone.

In this session we'll talk about some key concepts and design patterns for continuous deployment and integration in the cloud using technologies like Chef to enable better control of applications and infrastructures. We will discuss how the use of API-based services for the entire software tool chain &ndash; including source code, build, test, deployment and monitoring -- can both enable the automation of complex pipelines and ensure consistent results. We will cover resource provisioning, configuration management, application deployment including red/black and staggered deployments, software updates, as well as important metrics to review. We will share lessons learned from real-world examples of applying these principles to a running service.

Follow me on the journey how we learnt that bugs are product, QA is
rather quality actions, and DevOps is about ownership.

In the recent years we went through all the typical problems. We had
low quality tests that were sometimes also slow, flaky and broken for
a long time. Developers depended too much on operations team. They did
not care about monitoring. QA was a single person in the team, the
blocker role in release. We had too much open bugs we did not fix but
still spent huge amount of time maintaining them. Teams didn't feel
responsible for their feature, there was no clear rule which team is
responsible for upcoming bugs.

In my talk I will focus on the learnings of our journey and how we
solved these problems.

How it ended up in an agile company working in continuous delivery
that we don't have DevOps team nor QA team any more and still we have
solid test frameworks, we do trust in our tests, developers take full
ownership of the features they develop and are on call for critical
services, UX team is dealing with product bugs, and teams have clear
responsibility boundaries.

using the same API and toolset.  The infrastructure permits the
description of software services and hardware components in such a way
that any set of software packages can be deployed to any cloud provider
matching specified criteria.
For Katello i will show how to manage running instances, apply errata,
do updates, compare status with deployed images, manage content effectively.
All of this to simplify the life of sysadmins and devops.

eduScrum is an edit for Secondary Education/High School.

eduScrum uses the powerful ceremonies, roles and tools of Scrum. In this way the group owned scrum board gives the students an overview and the structure to make the group&rsquo;s work transparent. Every lesson starts with the stand-up, which sees to it that there is a focus and a bond, this also put them in the right work mode. The retrospectives help students to continuously improve their tactics.
In eduScrum learning is the key element: smarter learning, learning to cooperate better, more responsibility, more freedom, learning to get to know themselves better. Because of that eduScrum owns an extra ceremony: creating teams on the basis of additional qualities. Own and extra instruments have also been developed. These instruments challenge and appeal to young people. With that eduScrum puts a powerful pedagogic layer under Scrum.

Willy Wijnands, behalf of the eduScrum team.

Willy Wijnands is a science and physics teacher, Jan van Rossum is a science teacher, both on the Ashram College in Alphen aan de Rijn. Ellen Reehorst is an education designer and trainer. Together they form the eduScrum team and are developing an educational version of scrum: eduScrum.

As Kanban helps to highlight the bottlenecks in your project and
understand your workflow, make problems visible the same way in your
engineering processes, too.

The essence of continuous delivery is that your code base should
always be in a deployable state. And you want to add the less overhead
and complexity to your system.

What should happen if you want to deploy but tests are broken?  How
will you find out who or what broke them? Who will fix them? Was there
a problem with the tests? Is the VCS server down again? Or is it
really the feature broken?

I will talk about how frank communication on who broke the tests
helped us to solve these problems in a no-blame engineering culture.
Also I will present the technologies and methods we used to achieve
it.

G&aacute;bor T&ouml;r&ouml;k

After several years of back-end and front-end development, G&aacute;bor joined Prezi's QA team. At Prezi, he's always finding new ways to automatize product testing. He prefers Emacs over Vim.

He can't say no if you invite him for a drink, and if you don't see him for a short time, he's probably doing yoga in a quiet room or dancing at a psychedelic party.

Describe pain-points of currently existing CI tools based on practices/principles of the 21st century, and high level how I think this can be improved. Hinting to my open-space which is my second proposal.

Speaker:

Patrick van Dissel, Software Engineer working at Tricode in The Netherlands. I've been setting-up, maintaining and improving the continuous integration/delivery pipeline from the technical side for the last 2 years now. During this time I've been looking at all kinds of aspects to get better code and get it to production faster.

It boils down to:
I came to the conclusion that I'm not happy with the existing so called 'Continuous Integration' tools like Hudson/Jenkins, Go, TeamCity, AntHill, TravisCI, etc. They get the job done, but they don't follow the principles of this age, like:
- Configuration-as-Code
- Infrastructure-as-Code
- Keep It Simple Stupid
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Single Responsibility Principle
I've investigated if I could help improve the existing tools to up-to-date. But at a code level it just looked not doable.

So, in my free time, I started my own CI tool project. You can read the specifics at:

An ignite talk about the culture to promise and deliver 100% uptime in a mission critical environment. This 100% availability commitment requires a nonconventional way of working which is reflected in technology and processes, but most of all culture.  After working across the whole stack for over 10 years Patrick realized that all technical problems become trivial when compared with talented, moody, wonderful but utterly analog human beings.

Speaker:

Patrick de Zoete, a big bald geek that loves anything zombie and 6502 related, works for Schuberg Philis, a company that specializes in designing, building and running application landscapes for which it guarantees 100% availability to its customers, which include energy companies, banks and other financial institutions, and online retailers. To all of them their applications are critical to their business.
