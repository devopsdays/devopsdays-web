Working with Dedicated Teams Offshore
At some point every company chooses to outsource work either through a state side contractor or offshore. I think it is extremely helpful to not just articulate but advise the best approaches to choosing, working with and having success with an offshore partner. It can be done and there are many hybrid approaches that ensure delight for both sides.

My outline/flow would be the following


Outsourced the TV show&hellip;.so what is the reality?
The dream that can turn into a nightmare


Improper vetting of developers
Looking at cost as the driver instead of quality
Undefined specs
The communication gap
Project management black hole
Project based, agile or really agile


Cultural differences between US based developers and the rest of the world
When to subcontract outside the country
A rising tide raises all ships
How to do it right
Dedicated teams and mixed teams
Your next offshore project  - done the right way&hellip;

There is a buzz around #monitoringsucks in the DevOps community. But it ain't the tools, rather it is what you do with them! Monitoring is founded on the concept of detecting failure, and the practice is institutionalized across organizations of any size. I will explore common evils that stem from this core focus on failure and discuss the anti-patterns that ensue across operations. On the other hand, I will discuss other industries that have dealt with this problem successfully and with a consistent record of dramatically reducing failure rates. I will propose a new approach, 'tracking' that goes beyond monitoring, discuss its merits and what it will take to implement. The main idea is 'tracking close calls' and systematically improving apps and systems rather than monitoring for failures. 'Close calls' are the canaries in the coal mine, and they lead up to bigger failures but nobody pays attention to these. If we take a long tail analogy 'failures' are the head while 'close calls' are the tail of application issues.

Problems between teams begin when they are unaware of mutually critical information and unable to consider the perspectives and needs of other groups.

Bringing visibility to invisible work and considering the flow of work over efficiency of of work may help teams gain the perspective necessary to influence culture change.

We pretty much ignore invisible work. And that causes all kinds of problems &ndash; from unknown dependencies to excessive context switching to dark matter &ndash; it all costs money.

But it&rsquo;s also a problem when we focus on the most visible form of waste &ndash; inefficient activity. Horrors if a worker appear idle! Is making activities more efficient really less important than eliminating inactivity? Is the problem inactive workers or motionless work?

This talk aims to answer those questions and address the following topics:
&middot; The invisible cost of idle work and what can be done about it.
&middot; Why 100% capacity utilization doesn&rsquo;t work.
&middot; Why Queues matter.

As an operations person with over 15 years of experience working on, maintaining, and supporting large enterprises, SaaS services, and cloud computing, I want to present the operations side of what I perceive to be differing opinions on software packaging, why all software should be packaged in an OS native format, and software patching as part of the release management life-cycle.

Many release management processes fail to fully comprehend the value of building and using native OS packages - like RPM, DEB, MSI, etc.  I would like to present the thought process from the operations perspective on why using anything but an OS package to install software is 'problematic' for successfully releasing and maintaining stable server environments.

Discussion points will be focused on RPM's for the sake of time - but presented conceptually so the methods can be applied to other OS package management systems.

Perspectives, opinions, and answers to the following items will be included:

Why do those pesky operations people always want development to deliver software as 'RPM's' or 'DEB's' ?

How do you ensure all nodes are running exactly the same base software and components without specifying each and every file in your configuration management tool like puppet or chef?

How do you easily patch your systems as part of your release cycle?

Why should a compiler not be installed on a production system?

Why should production systems not use developer short cuts like pip and gem installations ?

Do you really want a war file in an RPM?  What value could that possibly add to the operational stability and release management cycle?

How do you ensure you can build a new node identical to one built 6 months or a year ago when scaling is needed?

How do you quickly and easily roll back a bad release?

What tools, methods, and strategies do you suggest if we are going to buy in to this and use native OS packaging for all software?

In the past 8 months, Stackdriver has gone from, well, not existing to dozens of beta customers.  We receive thousands of measurements per second from our customers and perform time series aggregations in real time.  The infrastructure for our hot data pipeline resides on AWS and is designed for scale, availability, consistency and performance using principles that originate in a book written in 1978.

Wait, what?  1978?

In this talk, we will discuss how the design choices we made for our stateless cell architecture were influenced by a book called Systemantics, first published 35 years ago.   We&rsquo;ll also demonstrate our cell architecture, which is a concept that you could reuse in your company.

For example, one of the quotes adorning the walls of our office is &ldquo;What could possibly go wrong?&rdquo;  This kind of defensive thinking permeates our consideration of software architecture, system architecture and cloud architecture.  Not only do we presume that things can go wrong, we usually presume that something is always going wrong, or at least partially wrong.

Our hot data pipeline is one of our key assets and was developed by pressure testing our design considerations with Systemantics quotes like:

Systems in general work poorly or not at all.
Complicated systems produce unexpected outcomes
The real world is what it is reported to the system
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.
The Fail-Safe Theorem: When a Fail-Safe system fails, it fails by failing to fail safe.

As we slowly move towards Infrastructure as Code paradigm, standard software development issues like maintainability and interdependency slowly creeps into operations/infrastructure code base. Though this is not a solved problem, mainstream software development practitioners have made significant progress on these. This talk will briefly focus on practices and reasoning behind those practices that can be used to to increase the agility in operation teams, so that they can respond to change faster without compromising the stability. The entire presentation will be subdivided in three sections detailing the strategies for enabling software development practices in operations.


Introducing change that perturb the system least and building  on top it. Enabling iterative development.

A lot of CI Servers today offer a lot of functionality out of the box or through plugins, but as projects and companies grow, the code base outgrows the initial setup and scalability becomes a concern. Ideally, all projects would have a very thin build plan that interacts with a build system that exposes a set of 'verbs' or actions that it can perform through a DSL. This way, the CI server is just a broker, pressing the right buttons, the real heavy work is on the build system and we don't really have to pay for a CI server. We can take it one step further if we package and release the build system as an artifact and bootstrap it as the first dependency of each project.

Project Sputnik was born of the idea to create an Ubuntu-based client-to-cloud platform for developers that leveraged devops tools and principles.  From its inception, the project was designed to involve developer feedback directly into the product development process and to conduct the effort publicly utilizing social media, including blogs, twitter, forums, and Dell's IdeaStorm. This session will discuss how, thanks to the power of the community, this concept went from project to product in a little over 6 months.

Background:

By linking together an Ubuntu-based laptop and an OpenStack cloud back-end, developers are able to model an entire environment on their client and then launch it to the cloud. Add to that a community-based library of language profiles to down load and auto-install and you have fluid devOps environment to build test and deploy.

In the enterprise, where there are existing organizational silos each with their own tools and processes, introducing a new tool/process/paradigm that employs rip &amp; replace approach stands little chance of success. A more nuanced approach that focuses on the services and their interfaces has much better chance to reduce friction and improve organizational adoption.
Taking a service provider posture, ops teams can offer 'services' that enable development teams to integrate routine operational tasks into the software development life-cycle and improve collaboration among different organization entities. For these services, ops teams can implement and manage the underlying infrastructure, and provide visual (UI) and programmatic (API) interfaces to all interested parties.
Operations teams have been moving from 'doing things for developers' (deploying, monitoring  apps, etc) towards implementing and operating solutions that enable developers to do things for themselves. Most common example of this trend is, operations teams implementing continuous deployment solutions by leveraging configuration management tools like Puppet &amp; Chef, enabling developers to deploy applications into production themselves. This talk will look at some other services that can (and should) be provided by ops teams such as:


Log management as a service; enabling developers to emit logs, collecting logs from servers, applications, network devices, etc., and make them available to developers via UIs and APIs
Metrics as a service; enabling developers to easily collect and access metrics for their applications, as well as accessing other relevant monitoring data that may be collected by operations.
Alert management as a service; enabling developers to define runbooks, create alerts and receive notifications
The talk will describe how to implement these solutions conceptually to minimize organizational resistance, as well as outlining some of the tool sets that are useful in implementing these services.

Narrative story telling is an approach from Cognitive Edge that is used to generate and collect anecdotes that are more useful in conveying the truth than deliberately crafted discussions.   I&rsquo;ve used this approach with large organizations in place of traditional IT Ops assessments.

Malware has changed the way we think about Information Security.  It&rsquo;s time to rethink the way we deal with newly engineered advanced malware.  Management and technical staff will leave with actionable information on how to lower incident related costs through better detection and response

Stuxnet, Duqu, Flamer and Red October went undetected for years.  We need a new approach to deal with advanced malware.  Anti-Virus companies admit 80% of malware is unique to 10 companies or less.  This talk will share advanced malware detection techniques from the folks in the trenches and what you can actually do to prepare for and detect it.  Management and technical staff will leave with actionable information on how to lower incident related costs through better detection and response and integration into DevOps environments.

The presentation will discuss recent statistics, incidents and costs around APT and recent advanced malware events.  Anti-Malware defenses are failing everyone and only detects 5%, or less of this newly engineered advanced malware.  2012 annual reports by Verizon, Trustwave, Mandiant and others show this problem is only getting worse.  This talk will address the ever increasing failures of anti-malware solutions and examples of security defense solution failures will also be discussed.  The audience will be polled on their opinions and experiences.    Finally, we will introduce a new way of thinking and methodology to prepare organizations for detection of the simplest to the most advanced malware.  We will also show how this method can save significant costs in future incident response events.  Integrating this methodology into a DevOps environment will also be covered as DevOps environments are already ready to implement this new method.  Actual malware will be used in this presentation to illustrate the point.

These days everywhere I turn there's a lot of talk about managing configuration files, and deployed application versions. I hear the shouts from the roof tops about the power of today's configuration management tools such as Puppet and Chef. For all of the important and great work these tools do, there is something missing, basic system level file integrity checking and auditing. Configuration Management will ensure that /etc/sudoers has the right rules, and it may even ensure that your installed package version is the latest and greatest. You may have great reporting around your CM tools and can determine when the sudo package changed, but can you ensure that the version of sudo on your box today, is the one you expect to be there? Can you be sure that it hasn't been supplanted by an attacker targeting your system?

There are some commercial options, and there's the open source Tripwire which has been around for over 20 years was at one time the defacto standard for this type of work. Implementing auditd is a great option when you require an audit trail from the kernel level. However neither of these two solutions was a good fit for Rackspace, my employer. Tripwire simply wasn't meant to be implemented in a distributed fashion, and auditd is heavier handed than we could tolerate operationally. Our primary goals were to ensure protection from compromise and validate that some files are the exact versions we expect for proper functionality.

I am a systems engineer working on the Rackspace Cloud Computing product, and created Integrity, our system to fill the needs outlined above. I would like to share why the tool was created, how it was created, and what special considerations / solutions (such as no direct network connectivity to machines the tool needs to manage, an environment of tens of thousands of boxes, and potentially tens of thousands of changes) went into designing it.

Each 'Stack' or 'Cluster' is meant to represent either a single customer's segregated network or a shared service's member machines. Multiple Chef runs are coordinated via a simple Python daemon that handles transient Chef Server HTTP errors and other Exception handling.

We all talk about how to recruit and hire DevOps minded people, but something we don't often talk about is how to manage and retain them once you have hired them.  There are lots of studies and statistics that discuss how expensive it is when you lose an employee.  Often times the business side believes the only way to keep employees is via monetary compensation, and this is a terrible way to motivate.  I have found that motivating thru autonomy and purpose can yield a much higher benefit to all parties. Most important to Startups as they often are more cash constrained and need to compete with more profitable and established companies.

The Theory of Constraints states that an hour lost at a bottleneck essentially shuts down your organization. What happens when your constrained group (most likely your evolving operations team) loses a highly valued engineer?

We built two full-blown Q&amp;A applications, one in PHP/Yii and another one in JEE/Spring. However, what started out as a real-world test to exercise all the features of our product, turned into a lot more. We created a virtualized multi-machine environment that is automatically provisioned. This allowed everyone in the company to use this application as a reference point without having to go through any of the tedious configuration and setup tasks. Anyone, anywhere, can now quickly start up a predictable environment that behaves exactly the same for everyone else.

We noticed that many different people at ZeroTurnaround are now relying on it:


developers use it to enhance the product and fix bugs
QA use it to validate product features
content writers use it to reference working examples
sales uses it to demonstrate our products in a realistic setting
evangelists use it at demo booths
our CEO uses it for his webinars
and finally ... our customers use it as an inspiration for their own setups



In this talk we'll go through the different aspects of setting up such an automatically provisioned virtualized environment. We'll introduce Vagrant, Chef and how they work together. We'll share some of the mistakes we made, so that you can avoid them and you'll also see some of the custom provisioning scripts that we wrote and how we structure them. Finally, we'll demonstrate how it all comes together and highlight some of the notable uses of this setup amongst the ZeroTurnaround Rebels.

Goodbye to the trivial Hello World. Hello to the massively useful DevOps World!

Fundamental tension exists between development and operations/production DBAs.  Here are five principles that can be applied to ease the tension and improve results for deployed applications:
1.  Give developers direct monitoring visibility to production, staging and test servers.
2.  Enhance collaboration by making developers self-sufficient in their performance observations.
3.  Make performance a stated functional requirement. 
4.  Establish shared metrics and a basis for equal access to metric reports.
5.   Focus on the end-user experience.

The presentation will discuss these 5 principles in more detail and provide examples.   While some screen captures and examples will use a Confio product, the content and messaging will be independent of any software or specific product.

Who would be interested?   Developers who don't get along with their DBAs, or who don't understand what DBAs do.    Managers who are responsible for both development and DBA groups and who need to reduce fingerpointing.   Development managers who care about introducing application performance as a driving requirement for their development projects.

Enterprise DevOps practices increase team agility and decrease cycle times by automating handoffs between development and operations activities.  Early applications Platform as a Service (aPaaS) environments provide a useful run-time Cloud, yet often create a chasm between development best practices and operational deployment.  Enterprise DevOps PaaS delivers a holistic Cloud that bridges development time activities (e.g. continuous build, integration, and test), operations focus (e.g. continuous deployment, automated release management), and PaaS runtime policy management.  In this session, Chris Haddad will describe:


Why PaaS complements DevOps and scales DevOps across enterprise teams
Where to extend PaaS with Enterprise DevOps practices
How continuous automation, policy standardization, and PaaS fosters long-tail applications

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed by an interface that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision their own resources. It's designed to be massively scalable and can run on tens of thousands of machines. But no-one can easily understand a set of services that are running across tens of thousands of machines.

DevStack is a collection of bash scripts that will deploy a full working version of OpenStack on a single machine. It's typically used by developers but it's also an excellent way for operators to learn what makes OpenStack tick. You can follow along with this presentation and run DevStack in VirtualBox or in a cloud enviroment like the Rackspace Cloud, HP Cloud, or AWS EC2. You will learn what services make up OpenStack, how they interact with each other, how they interact with a client request, and how to trace the path of such a request. This will give you a concrete foundation for understanding OpenStack and being able to grow that knowledge by tinkering with its operations.

The new world order of business is increasingly centered on the speed in
which an organization can leverage digital commerce to rapidly deliver goods
and services to consumers.  This movement was ignited by the success of
companies such as Amazon and Google &ndash; who are disrupting traditional
businesses by serving consumers better and faster with innovative
technology.

To move at this kind of speed, businesses must transform.  This means IT
needs to be a front office strategic imperative to business and not the back
office support system for internal operations. The reality today is that
separation between Dev and Ops in large organizations still reigns supreme.
We all know this has to change.

In the Ops world many of us see DevOps as the future.  Our developer brethren
think about Agile development practices and moving from multi-month (or
year!) development cycles to short sprints.  We are all really talking about
the same thing.  Breaking down organizational boundary&rsquo;s and  integrating
teams to move faster.  Then integrating tool chains so that we have common
tooling and don&rsquo;t need to hand off artifacts (see CODE!) and continuously
delivering innovation for the business.  There is a process for making this
transition and that we here at Opscode have seen in practice.  George
Moberly will talk about the 5 key drivers of success in making that
transition.

I found an interesting option when assisting a friend with their MacBook Pro recently... the firmware offered to connect to Apple to restore OSX to the newly replaced, but empty hard drive. Basically embedded in the firmware, is all the software necessary to connect to wireless, download OSX, and format/install the hard drive &lsquo;The Apple Way&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s very similar to what happens when someone uses the instant infrastructure USB sticks, except that the experience isn&rsquo;t limited to Apple hardware, and currently focuses on Ubuntu.

USBs don&rsquo;t work in the cloud, nor do we have fancy apple firmware. However the venerable ISO 9660 image (cdrom/iso image) can be used as a cross platform &lsquo;bootable file system as a file&rsquo; that can be copied to a physical CD-ROM, DVD, USB, or uploaded as a cloud block devices and boot (yea bootable EBS) almost anything in the cloud or in the real world.

Since we control  the bootloader itself we can use any operating system the hardware or virtualization system can support. Windows, Ubuntu/Debian, Solaris, RHEL/Centos all support creating customized ISO images that automate deployment including installing the software for and connecting to your favorite automation code-kitchen.

In the real world, an NGO could send out CDs/DVD to their branch offices that when booted would configure hardware with an OS and connect it back to a centralized Chef Server for ongoing management.

Today when it comes to improving web application performance the focus of most developers is on front end optimizations such as asynchronous resource loading, JavaScript bundling, local storage caching and cache header optimization that live at Layer 7 of the network stack. However, while these types of optimizations are very important, with the growing demand to access web applications on mobile devices as well as conventional PCs the unique characteristics of the networks mobile devices operate on require that attention be paid to the performance all they way down to Layer 4.

Server failures don't get Ops out of bed at 2am. Customer impacting service outages do. So, in an era of autoscale, built-for-failure service platforms, why are monitoring deployments geared toward watching servers rather than services? Forget the server. Monitor the customer.&nbsp;

Once the Ops team is getting regular sleep, there's bandwidth available to address another deficiency: business value. Ops has traditionally been a cost-center, a necessary expenditure to keep the wheels on the bus. It doesn't have to be this way! Ops can deliver higher business value by measuring the metrics that matter to the business, and we can contribute that value in near real-time. DevOps should feed the business with metrics that enable insightful, responsive decision-making.&nbsp;
