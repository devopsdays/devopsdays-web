Bringing Developers and Operations together helps companies to be more efficient to bring out new apps and services. Devops are using today many tools and technics to achieve continuous integration, deployment and monitoring. In this presentation will see why NoSQL databases are the best for Devops, and this for many reasons:


Schemaless/Flexible schemas allow developers to get back the control of what&rsquo;s going in the application! (Old fashion DBA most of the time do not have enough knowledge of the application to drive the data model!)
Easy Scalability and always on are key! The new database engines are built to scale easily. You can change the topology of your cluster (adding node for example), manage failures and upgrade on a running system with no impact on the running application.



This presentation will use real life use cases to show that NoSQL engine ease the deployment and monitoring of new applications, and also talk about the key things to look when you chose a solution and deploy it.

"","talk","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/TransformerDesDevsEnDevops/","Fabrice Bernhard","Transforming devs into devops","This talk will be given in English

 English Abstract:

In the world of web development, the competence of a developer as perceived by his peers is usually more linked to his skills in system administration than his pure coding expertise. The polyvalence of the devops is indeed a quality that enables him to unblock critical situations, where a pure coder, even excellent, would be struggling.

Let us transform all the devs into devops then! It is unfortunately not that easy, since the greatest part of the polyvalence is based on experience, hard to transfer rapidly.

How can we accelerate the acquisition of experience? How can we transfer the 'scars' of the veteran sys-admin to the freshly-arrived juniors ? How can we help autodidact sysadmins adopt the devops philosophy? How can we avoid that the introduction of tools typically associated with devops culture (vagrant, chef, puppet, fabric, etc.) makes system administration become even more complex to the juniors?

These are the questions we have asked ourselves in our team, with some solutions and a few reflexion paths:
the devops folder


the homemade IAAS
the anti-magical provisioning
the sudo for all
the quality board
the pair-devopsing
the pseudo-on-call



The goal is to tackle all these subjects without prejudices and open reflexion topics that can be further discussed during the open-space sessions.

R&eacute;sum&eacute; en Fran&ccedil;ais:

Dans le monde du d&eacute;veloppement web, on constate que la valeur per&ccedil;ue d'un d&eacute;veloppeur par ses pairs est souvent plus li&eacute;e &agrave; ses comp&eacute;tences en administration syst&egrave;me qu'en ses comp&eacute;tences en d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; proprement parler. La polyvalence du devops est en effet la qualit&eacute; qui permet de d&eacute;bloquer les situations les plus difficiles, quand les autres d&eacute;veloppeurs, m&ecirc;me excellents, pataugent.

Une grande partie de cette polyvalence est bas&eacute;e sur l'exp&eacute;rience, difficile &agrave; transmettre rapidement. Comment acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer l'acquisition d'exp&eacute;rience ? Comment faire adopter la philosophie devops aux autodidactes de l'administration syst&egrave;me ? Comment &eacute;viter de remplacer la magie de la mise en production par les 'admins' en magie de la mise en production par 'le script' et impliquer les d&eacute;veloppeurs sur ces aspects ?

Voici les questions que nous avons &eacute;t&eacute; amen&eacute;s &agrave; nous poser dans notre &eacute;quipe, avec quelques solutions et encore plusieurs pistes de r&eacute;flexion :


le dossier 'devops' dans chaque projet
mise en place d'un IAAS low-cost avec LXC et Fabric
provisioning simple : fabtools VS chef-solo
vagrant
pair-deploying



Le but est d'aborder ce sujets sans pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s et ouvrir des pistes de r&eacute;flexion &agrave; approfondir en open-space

Pourquoi ?

J'aimerais que tous les devs dans l'&eacute;quipe soient des devops aguerris. Mais je me rends compte que c'est plus facile &agrave; dire qu'&agrave; faire.

D'ailleurs quand on regarde les offres de formation, on se rend compte qu'il en existe pl&eacute;thores en d&eacute;veloppement, et quasiment aucune en gestion d'infrastructure web. La transmission de l'exp&eacute;rience, des 'cicatrices' pour reprendre l'expression d'un devops lors d'un meetup, est difficile &agrave; rendre m&eacute;thodique. Et l'introduction des outils typiquement associ&eacute;s &agrave; la culture devops (vagrant, chef, puppet, fabric, etc.) ne garantit pas une mont&eacute;e en comp&eacute;tences au contraire, elle peut faire para&icirc;tre l'administration syst&egrave;me encore plus complexe pour le d&eacute;veloppeur junior. Bref sujet passionnant mais sans solution magique pour l'instant.

Although DevOps is one of the hot topics for C-level executives, a lot of initiatives fail or don&rsquo;t produce value for an organization. However, the roll-out of Agile methodologies increases the pressure on development and operations to improve the ability to take new applications and features into production.

The session describes a tool-independent blueprint of a successful DevOps reference implementation in a large multi-national organization, highlighting the key factors that are necessary and how organizations can transform their infrastructure re-using the different capabilities they already have.

"","talk","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/ReleaseManagementIgnite/","Sylvain Cailliau","Release management at the speed of agile","This talk will be given in English

Abstract:

Release management happens once software has gone through the process of development and testing. However, as teams move over to agile, they begin put through more software releases as they change from long development phases to shorter sprints that track against the business requirements more closely. More releases means more change in production. The DevOps movement is familiar with this, and working to change the situation.

There are three areas where discussion and integration can take place, and that is what this talk will go through, based on experience of enterprise software organisations and deployments of release management and automation.

Theme #1 - Automation

Automating release management should solve a lot of the problems that exist for DevOps teams. And it will do. But it is not the only step that has to be thought about. Release automation is the technical step that has to be achieved, but there are two other areas that also have to be considered.

Once releases are automated, putting a calendar for release scheduling in place is a really good idea. Agile teams don't work in isolation, but they do have to think about dependencies and when releases are switched into production after testing. This is a simple step that makes the automation process deliver the goods. In enterprise environments, I have found that this calendaring can be difficult as teams are more spread out and dispersed, so having on version of the truth really helps.

Secondly, putting releases into a framework and history is a necessary step as well. Larger organisations will want this for their own audit and control purposes, while it is still worth having for smaller organisations as it helps with tracking problems. After all, those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.

Theme #2 - Process

Getting release automation in place does not happen by magic. It does take time and collaboration across teams. What can be valuable for everyone involved in this is the establishment of baseline processes that should be followed during each release. Steps within these processes can then be automated as well, rather than relying on human action that can bring in errors. This can also help when judging the appropriate process for releases - not all will require the same level of rigour as others, if they don't touch on core systems or don't have dependencies that could lead to issues.

There are also steps that organisations can take around role splits - ensuring that people can't put their own software into production without the appropriate testing or release approval for example. The balance point is that these steps should bot get in the way of release management and automation, but that they help it get completed quicker by proving that work is good.

Theme #3 - Continuous

The move to continuous deployment and continuous delivery fits really well with release automation. However, how each of these steps is then linked together can be more interesting. With some of the eneterprises I have been working with, we have established the concept of the 'trust line' - that is, how far along the process can something be automated between development and production.

For smaller or non-critical releases, steps around testing may be fully automated and if they are passed, releases can be put in automatically. for critical projects, the UAT and testing phase may remain manual. Each release should be judged according to its potential impact, and how much value it can offer by getting into production faster.

Then a quick note about rework. One of the big pain points in the enterprise is the amount of rework that is taking place around projects. Getting the right approach in place around release management can free up time spent on manually managing deployments, and that time can instead be spent on making sure that code is better in the first place. Automation of releases should sit alongside more traceability of code - this means being able to point to good work and bad. Taking some of the timescale pressure that implementation and release can lead to and instead focusing on getting stuff right first time is therefore a strong secondary benefit.

"","talk","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/RefonteAgileApplicationObsolete/","Fabrice Bernhard","Refonte agile d'une application obsolète","Abstract:

Entre les d&eacute;buts du web, la sortie de Rails 1.0 en 2005, et maintenant Rails 3, Symfony2 Play2, Zend Framework2, Django 1.5 etc. beaucoup d'applications webs critiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es sur des architectures improvis&eacute;es et des technologies aujourd'hui obsol&egrave;tes. Ces applications sont difficiles &agrave; faire &eacute;voluer et repr&eacute;sentent un vrai danger pour la v&eacute;locit&eacute; des entreprises qui en d&eacute;pendent.

La solution de tout jeter pour recommencer est peut-&ecirc;tre tentante pour l'&eacute;quipe de d&eacute;veloppeurs mais c'est une solution extr&ecirc;mement risqu&eacute;e en termes de continuit&eacute; de services. Pour diminuer le risque, il faut avoir une approche agile &agrave; la fois dans le d&eacute;veloppement des &eacute;volutions et dans la mise &agrave; jour de l'application en production et bien coordonner les deux aspects : il faut une approche devops.

Bas&eacute;e sur l'exp&eacute;rience de plusieurs projets, nous aborderons les 7 &eacute;tapes chronologiques de la refonte agile d'un existant associ&eacute;es &agrave; des solutions culturelles et techniques que nous avons identifi&eacute;es :


pr&eacute;vention des r&eacute;gressions
mise &agrave; jour de l'infrastructure
gestion du routing et des entr&eacute;es/sorties
partage du layout
int&eacute;gration de la session
amorcer la transition la du code vers une architecture orient&eacute;e service
migration progressive du mod&egrave;le et des donn&eacute;es



Nous verrons au passage que l'essentiel des probl&eacute;matiques rencontr&eacute;es pendant une refonte agile sont celles auxquelles s'int&eacute;resse le mouvement devops.

Pourquoi ?

Le sujet de la migration progressive de Symfony1 vers Symfony2 est un sujet sur lequel nous travaillons beaucoup chez Theodo et Allomatch. En effet dans les deux soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nous travaillons &eacute;norm&eacute;ment avec Symfony et la version 2 n'est pas juste une am&eacute;lioration mais un nouveau framework, donc pas de migration automatique possible.

Au fur et &agrave; mesure que nous avons pris du recul sur le sujet nous nous sommes rendus compte que l'ensemble des solutions que nous mettons en place sont haut-niveau et donc g&eacute;n&eacute;ralisables &agrave; n'importe quel langage ou framework. Nous nous rendons aussi compte que beaucoup des solutions que nous apportons sont culturelles et que nous introduisons sous couvert de 'solution innovante de migration progressive' tout un ensemble de bonnes pratiques devops sur les projets : monitoring business, int&eacute;gration continue, pipeline de d&eacute;ploiement automatis&eacute;, releases petites et r&eacute;guli&egrave;res, etc. D'un point de vue haut-niveau, ce que nous apportons c'est un regain de v&eacute;locit&eacute; sur des projets embourb&eacute;s, ce qui &agrave; mon avis est exactement l'objectif de la philosophie devops.

J'ai d&eacute;j&agrave; abord&eacute; notre exp&eacute;rience sur la migration progressive de Symfony1 &agrave; Symfony2 en conf&eacute;rences, je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion d'aborder le sujet d'un point de vue non Symfony et plus devops.

In our hosting company, we use Chef to manage all user and web app configuration on our shared and private hosting environments. We've put this power in the hands of our end users through Sock, our control panel. What first started out as an automation tool for managing new servers, is now our core server configuration tool for us as well as our customers and their customers. Where a DirectAdmin, cPanel or Plesk failed in giving us an overhead management is where our Sock + Chef solution picked up. With Ruby Developers and Sysadmins literally at the same table, we were able to concurrently build the two sides of this story.

Our talk will show how we use Chef to continuously manage not only the servers but everything on it (accounts, webapps, ssh keys, Solr, Varnish, databases, &hellip;). We want to show how we use Chef in a dynamic way to shuffle and manage user- and web app configurations across a large pool of shared and dedicated servers.

"","talk","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/lpuppet/","Simon Marechal","Optimizing your Puppet workflow with fast software and strong tests","Abstract:

The 'infrastructure as code' mantra is followed by countless sysadmins around the world. The choice of words implies that practices from the development world should be adopted by sysadmins, yet one would be overjoyed to be able to implement the basics. Functionalities taken as granted for developers, such as easily debugging a configuration or writing complex tests, have currently no real equivalent in the devops world.

This talk will start by an overview of common practices developed around the Puppet tool, such as following development conventions, unit-testing modules, using vagrant setups to test changes, and using a good IDE. It will be followed by a rant about how these practices and tools are either a far cry from what is sorely needed, or in some cases entirely unusable. It will then describe a common anti-pattern that derives from these limitations.

The presentation will then switch to a long demonstration, highlighting functionalities of the language-puppet library and associated tools. The following subjects will be demonstrated:


quickly testing for syntax and semantic correctness at the catalog level: testing that syntax is OK, that all resources are properly defined, that all relationships between resources are valid, that there are no problems with the templates and that all sourced files are present
quickly getting the difference between two catalog, either between distinct servers or between two versions of the same configuration, including a demonstration of the usefulness of such a feature in template development
writing very strong tests, such as testing for interactions between nodes, arising from the use of exported resources or calls to the PuppetDB



If time permits, a few words on the important of performance in such tools will be given. The talk will then conclude with a preview of future features of the library, and a good dose of Haskell proselytism.

"","talk","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/NormalisedInstanceProvisioning/","Karanbir Singh","Normalised instance provisioning for dev, on-premise and public clouds","Abstract:

Cloud and Virtualised Infrastructure rely on machine instances as the user facing platform. However, this very machine instance is one of the hardest and trickiest resource to provision out of traditional operating systems. Being able to do so consistently across multiple vendor requirements, site requirements and environment requirements usually involves either relying on a third party built instance, a vendor purpose built  - and often slow releasing - instance or having to setup large infrastructure inhouse.

Looking to solve this problem we came up with project raindrops. This aims to resolve some of the issues and bridge the traditional deploymnet roles ( eg. kickstarts ) with cloud and virtualised infrastructure requirements ( eg. static images ); At the head of the problem space we are trying to solve is the idea that a single defition of the required machine instance should be consumeable in multiple environments like on-laptop KVM / Vmware / Vagrant as well as incloud environments like OpenStack, CloudStack, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus as well as public on-demand environments like AWS, Dell Cloud, HPCloud etc.

In this talk, I will expand on the problem space and propose some solutions, as well as demonstrate a unified ( git, web and rest ) interface to instance provisioning across multiple vendors and environments. By the end of this talk attendees should have a good understanding of how they can integrate instance building into existing CI and CD platforms, without needing the infrastructure needed to stay vendor agnostic.

Honsh&#363;, or Honshuu, is the largest island of Japan.

It is also the codename for the complete rewrite of Server Density that has been over a year in the making, embracing a service orientated architecture similar to those popularised by Amazon and Netflix.

At the heart of Honshuu is the idea that every service is an island. Any island can talk to another, using strict traditions and customs, and almost any island can communicate freely with the wider world via intermediaries and guardians of custom.

Each island is the main land, looking after it's own concerns, only caring that other islands can communicate with it, but not what goes on outside.

This is a cultural shift away from other ways of working more than technological. Knowing when to spin out a new 'island' and making sure it can be communicated with in the same fashion as it's neighbours, from common build strategies regardless of base technology, to involving ops as a guiding principle from the very first steps as to how an island should be built.

Azure platform is no exception to this rule. Of course, Azure allows to create and deploy new applications and their underlying infrastructure in minutes. But to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by this new paradigm, we have to rethink these new services models definition, deployment automation, configuration and updates management, health and performance monitoring, alert notifications, and especially the development process integration with IT operation services.

GOV.UK is the new digital home of the British Government.

In the first week of GOV.UK being released, code was deployed to production 74 times. And for the last five months alone the release process for operations has gone through large changes.

In this talk I'm going to provide some background on GOV.UK and GDS, describe the different release processes we've gone through, explain how we've enabled an open and accountable release process, and detail some of the wins/pitfalls along the way.

Specifically, these include:


How we optimised for moving fast
How we restructured, aiming for stability of the platform; and
How we've come to our current release process



There will, of course, be a description of our technical infrastructure and tools. However, the biggest discussion point will be how we're trying to deliver high quality public services, quickly, with the multidisciplinary teams we have.

The entire talk will be presented as a historical account of how we've changed as we've gained more people and how this has guided the way we work.

Native packages are perfectly suited for any applications, on premise or cloud based.
And they could be used with Puppet/Chef tooling, managing the hard part, aka componenting/packaging part, freeing our Puppet/Chef Master from complex recipes.

In 2012, Axway ECD Team started to create a rich catalog of Forge solutions like Jenkins, Artifactory, Nexus, Archiva, Jira, Confluence but also Subversion or Git to provide 'CI as service' to Dev and QA teams.

This talk will present what have been done, RPMs, Packages factory using Jenkins and ESXi, Dev/QA/Prod silos, staging/promotion and internal yum repositories for world-wide deliveries.

Abstract:

When was the last time you had a great time calling Customer Support? Can't remember? You're not alone.

Customer support in technology means anything from googling around for answers on blogs, to a curt injunction to RTFM on irc, to being shoved around on an IVR and praying that the person who picks up the phone knows what they're doing. It's alienating and counter-productive.

When you run a service online, you have a number of advantages:


You (can and should) know what your users and customers are doing in real-time.
You can very easily reach out to them individually or as a group, synchronously or asynchronously, wherever they are in the world.
You can offer them a fast turnaround and a great degree of visibility into what you are doing to help them.
You can accurately measure whether you are making a difference.



So you can make your customers love you more easily than if you were selling physical goods in a store.

In this presentation I would like to present what we came up with in terms of goals, tools, metrics for customer support. Why is this relevant to you? Everybody has customers, whether internal or external. And as it happens that the customers we are serving at Datadog, are you, the devops community.

What if you could create and manage a similar service on top of any cloud? In this session we will introduce Cloudify, a new open source PaaS framework. Cloudify takes a different approach by using recipes (as opposed to heavyweight coding and platform extension) as a means to introduce new application stacks to the PaaS layer. You can think of it as extending the recipe model of Chef to support application level concerns such as orchestration, dependency management, multi-tier and multi-host deployments, monitoring and auto-scaling. This session will introduce how Cloudify leverages Chef as a key enabler for an open PaaS framework.

In 2010 3 of us started to build a product for the devops crowd, predicated on a few napkin drawings and 2 basic ideas: (a) software engineers who write software for scale, live and die by metrics and (b) these metrics come from a zillion different tools that create silos. We chose a memorable name and a cute logo and off to the races.

Fast-forward 3 years, the 3 have become 15, the product has evolved into a monitoring service and the company is gaining new customers every week without any marketing.

In these short 3 years we have had to:


find our customers (you, here) and find our focus,
scale from a single postgres instance to 5 different datastores all working in concert,
swap out parts of the backend as they become bottleneck
build X-ops into the core of the company (where X in [dev, tech, customer]),
discover a whole set of new metrics to obsess about,
learn something new every day, really.

Testing tools for our configuration management tooling lags behind testing for our application code. Application testers can talk about the testing pyramid, where a large number of fast, specific, unit-level tests are at the base, supporting a much smaller number of higher-level end-to-end tests which may integrate with external components. But typically for configuration management tools, and particularly Puppet, the tooling does not allow us to write fast, unit-level tests; every test is an end-to-end test, even if it only makes unit-level assertions.

In this ignite talk, I will present fizzgig, a new library for writing unit tests in Puppet. This brings a number of benefits to testing configuration management that application tests already have: removing fixtures in preference of keeping all test data within the test; faster performance; tests which fail for a specific reason thus aiding debugging. I will give examples of puppet modules where good unit tests would have helped improve quality.

"","ignite","http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/ReleaseManagementIgnite/","Sylvain Cailliau","Release management at the speed of agile","This talk will be given in English

Abstract:

Release management happens once software has gone through the process of development and testing. However, as teams move over to agile, they begin put through more software releases as they change from long development phases to shorter sprints that track against the business requirements more closely. More releases means more change in production. The DevOps movement is familiar with this, and working to change the situation.

There are three areas where discussion and integration can take place, and that is what this talk will go through, based on experience of enterprise software organisations and deployments of release management and automation.

Theme #1 - Automation

Automating release management should solve a lot of the problems that exist for DevOps teams. And it will do. But it is not the only step that has to be thought about. Release automation is the technical step that has to be achieved, but there are two other areas that also have to be considered.

Once releases are automated, putting a calendar for release scheduling in place is a really good idea. Agile teams don't work in isolation, but they do have to think about dependencies and when releases are switched into production after testing. This is a simple step that makes the automation process deliver the goods. In enterprise environments, I have found that this calendaring can be difficult as teams are more spread out and dispersed, so having on version of the truth really helps.

Secondly, putting releases into a framework and history is a necessary step as well. Larger organisations will want this for their own audit and control purposes, while it is still worth having for smaller organisations as it helps with tracking problems. After all, those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.

Theme #2 - Process

Getting release automation in place does not happen by magic. It does take time and collaboration across teams. What can be valuable for everyone involved in this is the establishment of baseline processes that should be followed during each release. Steps within these processes can then be automated as well, rather than relying on human action that can bring in errors. This can also help when judging the appropriate process for releases - not all will require the same level of rigour as others, if they don't touch on core systems or don't have dependencies that could lead to issues.

There are also steps that organisations can take around role splits - ensuring that people can't put their own software into production without the appropriate testing or release approval for example. The balance point is that these steps should bot get in the way of release management and automation, but that they help it get completed quicker by proving that work is good.

Theme #3 - Continuous

The move to continuous deployment and continuous delivery fits really well with release automation. However, how each of these steps is then linked together can be more interesting. With some of the eneterprises I have been working with, we have established the concept of the 'trust line' - that is, how far along the process can something be automated between development and production.

For smaller or non-critical releases, steps around testing may be fully automated and if they are passed, releases can be put in automatically. for critical projects, the UAT and testing phase may remain manual. Each release should be judged according to its potential impact, and how much value it can offer by getting into production faster.

Then a quick note about rework. One of the big pain points in the enterprise is the amount of rework that is taking place around projects. Getting the right approach in place around release management can free up time spent on manually managing deployments, and that time can instead be spent on making sure that code is better in the first place. Automation of releases should sit alongside more traceability of code - this means being able to point to good work and bad. Taking some of the timescale pressure that implementation and release can lead to and instead focusing on getting stuff right first time is therefore a strong secondary benefit.

What happened:

You have launched a new project to build a web site. The architecture was just great. One year of development is planned. Production date right before Christmas. Iterative process. Small iterations. A clear roadmap maximizing the time to market. Life is good.

One month before production, confident, you enter performance testing. A disaster. During development, response time were OK. Nothing to worry about. And you were sure the production servers were so powerful that they could solve any unexpected slowness. What a mistake! A state of emergency is declared. Work spread over the week-end and during your shortened holidays. You manage to fix the issue. It's not great, but it's alright. Post mortem: Three months late, 40% over budget and decent performances. Your end of year bonus, a bit less decent.

Now, come to see how it could have been:

Controlled performances all along the project. Going live without issues. And, most importantly, Christmas holidays in Tahiti with a Daiquiri.

Et maintenant, venez voir comment &ccedil;a aurait pu se passer:

Performances ma&icirc;tris&eacute;es tout au long du projet. Mise en production sans soucis. Vacances de No&euml;l &agrave; Tahiti et Daiquiri.

Sceptiques? Alors venez.

In today's world, multiple people need to understand and manage IT infrastructure. However, each player has different information needs, and needs to view the system according to different criteria and different levels of abstraction. For example, a sysadmin needs to know which versions of Apache are installed on different machines, but a web developer looking at the same system cares only that the web server is operational and with the appropriate configuration for deploying his applications. At the same time, a security and reliability engineer needs to manage where in the world the machines are located and how their distribution reduces the possibility of total system failures. And the CTO may only care about saying 'give me a datacenter' and having it work as expected.

These needs have upped the ante for configuration management tools. Modern IT people (developers, operations, architects, networking, security etc.) need tools that allow multi-level understanding and management of the systems. In this talk I will sketch some of the requirements for such a system, and explore how our existing tools need to be improved in order to effectively achieve these goals.
