 It's been five years since the first DevOpsDays in the sleepy little Belgian town of Gent. DevOps is now all the rage and everyone is talking about DevOps, doing DevOps, selling DevOps, or 'thought leading' DevOps. But the success of DevOps is also it's downfall. The practitioners often like to blame the marketers and opportunists for the downfall.

 Analysts blame the 'trough of disillusionment'. But the reality of the situation is that YOU are to blame. Marketers, Opportunists, Practitioners, Recruiters, Analysts, Enterprise IT, StartUps, Devs, Ops, and DevOps all have will a role in the downfall of the movement if we don't change the way we act, transform, inform, and inspire others to change.

 This talk will focus on the current problems in DevOps, and provide attendees with solutions to take out into the DevOps and IT community to improve DevOps as it scales across the greater IT community.

Speaker:

Michael Ducy (@mfdii) currently works as an Solutions Architect for Chef focused on designing and implementing automation solutions for customer's Cloud, IT Automation, and Continuous Delivery needs. Michael has worked in a variety of roles in his career including Systems Engineering , Performance Engineering, and IT Instructor.

You could see DevOps as expanding the mindset, toolset and processes which started with Agile. Where Agile focuses on creating maximum business value as soon as possible, DevOps can help you to actually deliver this working software quickly. Finally a Minimal Viable Product makes real sense.

But just as we found out time after time with agile adoption projects, the gap between business and IT is often a bottleneck and not an easy one to resolve. With DevOps this often becomes an even bigger bottleneck since it is more technical. A feature is something the business partners can understand but the time needed for upgrades is often harder to explain.

DevOps is not just a matter of integrating Ops work into Scrum. It is important to clearly define and plan the input. In this talk we would like to focus on questions like; How are we going ...


to help the business with this changed reality?
to be able to cope with unplanned work (like incidents) while retaining a sustainable pace?
to show the benefits of DevOps to the business on short term?
to make sure that all important work is going to be planned on time?
to make sure features aren&rsquo;t always are prioritized above quality and security?

Many organizations are challenged with the rise of cloud-based web applications that allow for quick-fire releases in response to issues or requests from the user community. Responsiveness is the goal of every software development organization but it puts a strain on functional teams, typically resulting in more defects and disruption. DevOps develops a partnership between Development and Operations, supporting operational requirements like deploy scripts, diagnostics, load and performance testing. The operations team provides support and feedback before, during and after deployment. Attendees learn how this partnership enables better responsiveness to issues and requests and how DevOps delivers value and TCO.

Microservices seems to be one of the most important coming architectural shifts in the Software Development, but is the current way we manage infrastructure able to support this new way of building software?
In this talk I will argue, based on the research done on the Complex Adaptive Systems and Emergent Behaviour, that VMs and centralised Orchestration reached their physical limits and will soon will be replaced with Containers able to deliver performance comparable to the smaller parts of the Microservices based systems. This talk will also lead to the inevitable conclusion that our future software systems will need to be decentralised to be able to address the next big challenge - the separation of the software between multiple physical locations and multiple clouds and cloud providers.
The last piece of the puzzle is the Organisational Structure to support the changes above. In this talk I will compare the DevOps idea to the similar structural changes which happened in the past in other areas of Software Development, for example - Software Testing.

Within DEVOPS we often hear about Culture. CAMS, Culture, Culture, Culture, but what exactly is culture? Described as 'the most difficult word to define in the English language', culture can be a slippery topic.

Anyone looking to understand culture in order to change behaviour will quickly find themselves facing a challenge; am I talking about company culture? Departmental culture? Team culture? I will argue that all cultural changes begin with one individual influencing another.

Whilst seemingly obvious, this is a powerful realization. By first understanding how to influence an individual's behaviour, we can start to build a graspable model of organizational change which can be used by anybody looking to change those around them; Perhaps you'd like your team mates to try out new technologies? You'd like members of a team you manage to share knowledge between themselves more often? You'd like your boss to be less conservative in his decision making? You'd like everyone in a department you manage to do things differently?

Terms like 'power' and 'subordination' are unpopular these days due to their hierarchical undertones. I will show that all changes in culture rely on the successful usage of various types of power and that if the traditional hierarchies in your company have gone, other perhaps invisible power structures will already have taken root.

Understanding this is the key to changing behavior, and through doing so, changing culture.

What is one of the most important differences between Medieval Europe and the Age of Enlightenment? It&rsquo;s the importance we put in facts. To be more precisely it&rsquo;s the combination of clearly stated principles, experimentation and the will to learn and adjust principles accordingly. The ideas driving the Enlightenment are still of great value to DevOps.

Hypotheses are everywhere. In ideas from the business to increase growth, in assumptions by technical teams on how to fix certain problems, and how new functionality will work once in production.

Using examples from live web sites, Adriaan and Ruben will share their experiences. They will show real examples where using metrics shortened lead times, prevented waste and helped teams improve their service to the customers.

DevOps, when done right, usually goes unnoticed. It&rsquo;s only when something breaks that all eyes turn to IT. If your boss only sees you when the app is down, however, that&rsquo;s not really doing your career any favors. In this session we&rsquo;ll talk about how to prove your value to the organization by looking at the positive side &ndash; that is, how much money you&rsquo;ve saved your company. We&rsquo;ll take a look at how you can use tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Sensu and Logstash/Kibana to quantify your value to your company.

 Software development nowadays is done in teams. We develop in branches, isolating changes while they are in development. Then we merge them into the main stream, then we build the product, and deploy its new version to production. Sometimes our build step fails because of merge conflicts or broken tests. Everybody understands these failures as a positive side effect of quality control we have in place. Build failures prevent production failures, which essentially are much more important.

In the project I'm going to talk about we've made one step further in quality control. We started to control quality and fail even earlier, during merging of our branches into the main stream. This mechanism is known as 'pre-flight builds'. We integrated together Jenkins, Docker, JIRA, Git and our custom software. All together they started to act as an intelligent agent that picks up JIRA tickets when they are ready, attempts to merge their branches into Git master, attempts to build the entire product inside Docker container, and pushes changes to Github repository.

I believe that our experience will be interesting to share with other DevOps specialists.

Monitoring to many organisations is like back-up, its the thing you implement when you're just about to launch production and realise that you're not really able to see if your application is responding properly.  This is largely proliferated by the huge following that #monitoringsucks has created, spawned by a raft of tools with narrow scopes and varying levels of implementation.  People are trying to build their own monitoring stacks like kit cars in a quest to get a platform which is relevant and valuable.  Monitoring is looking like a snowflake, its unique for everyone and its a burden to manage&hellip;  Imagine what this is like at a Service Provider!  We have an entire snowstorm of snowflakes to make sure all of our customers are served to a suitable level!

Rackspace would like to reset the playing field by building open monitoring stacks on a few key principles:
* Monitoring is not a snowflake
* We will break the relationship between tuning effort and value returned
*  Monitoring should be able to save you from future incidents rather just than show you the house is on fire

This talk will discuss the problems that we are trying to solve for and some of our favourite solutions that are on the table right now.  We will also try to shed some light on a future view of the world where monitoring becomes the starting point for architectures because it yields the power to completely change your view of where and how you develop.

DevOps is a movement that is gaining traction within IT. Much focus is given to aspects such as tooling and the use of Agile methodologies. However, DevOps has a deep influence that has the potential to create a completely new paradigm within IT. The key is to understand the key aspects of the integration of the two disciplines and how to manage these to a successful conclusion. Secondly, we need to be aware of what the impact of this fundamental change in the way IT is organized and run on the environment.

Three years ago the Developers and the Operations people of the IT department of ING Retail Banking Netherlands were divided by a huge wall of confusion. Development was governed by CMMi, Prince2 project management, Operations was ruled by ITIL processes. Delivering new functionality via the traditional waterfall took a long time, going from requirements gathering, to impact analysis, application architecture design, functional design, technical design,development, testing to finally release to production. Instability caused by changes was counteracted by making up ever increasing list of acceptance criteria which had to be fulfilled in order to get an application deployed into production.

Then a small number of development teams discovered the benefits working Agile/Scrum. Pretty soon all of Development wanted to work Agile. At first Operations was terrified by this development (try reading the Agile manifesto as a tradition ITIL worker and not being terrified). But once management caught on there was no going back: DevOps was here to stay within ING! And processes were declared dead and the good citizens of ING were happy once more.

But are processes really dead?

This presentation will tell you how we at ING made the transition from a traditional Process oriented IT organization to DevOps. Without losing sight of the beneficial bits of ITIL. How do we combine the two and how do they complement one another. And which battles still need to be fought for the war to be over.

The challenge we were facing about 1.5 years ago was how to transform a consultancy company into a product company. Where the main focus of Oelan was on test and integration consultancy the plan is to grow into a company that combines product development and operations with consultancy (on the products) in a short period of time.
The basic idea was to embrace and strengthen the skills that Oelan was using in consultancy and add skills to enable product development and service operations. This meant that the agile way of working (in business agility) the transparency and trust had to be preserved while adding an operational and product development mentality. All this combined we started implementing it all the DevOps way.
In this presentation we discuss the experience of a year of fun, hard working, creating teams, moving from &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done when it runs on my laptop&rdquo; to an integrated setup. We have used continuous integration tools from the start to create an environment where automatic deployment is standard, testing and monitoring is key and solving problems using teamwork is in our DNA.
The current environment has been growing organically, in a &ldquo;Grow with the flow&rdquo; fashion. During this year we have moved from a simple one laptop system for a single product to a cloud based building and deployment environment for a number of web-based applications that are in various stages of maturity.
In the process of setting up the teams, the tools and the technical infrastructure we learned a lot: social, operational and technical.

Historically, Windows has been difficult to automate and configure.
The few tools that existed were weak and serious automation required
manipulating a plethora of APIs.  Over the last 6 years Microsoft has
transformed the Windows platform with substantial investments in:

  * PowerShell
  * Standards-based management


These investments have dramatically improved the ability of admins
(and developers) to automate enterprise and cloud datacenters.  With
the release of Windows Server 2012, nearly everything can be automated
locally or remotely using PowerShell or standards-based management
tools (even from Linux machines).

The needs of business-critical IT spawned the DevOps movement and the
need for uniform automation, rapid provisioning and repeatable
high-quality IT operations.  This spawned a new generation of Desired
State Configuration management tools.  These tools have had limited
success on Windows largely due to a mismatch of management
abstractions (Linux is a document-oriented OS whereas Windows is an
API-oriented OS).

In this talk I will present an overview of Windows management
progress.  I will discuss early failures in bringing Unix management
tools to Windows &ndash; why they didn&rsquo;t work and what we needed to do to
make progress.  I&rsquo;ll discuss our standards based management efforts
including OMI - our open source implementation of standards based
management.  I&rsquo;ll spend the bulk of the talk describing how
standards-based management and open protocols fit into the Desired
State Configuration landscape.  I&rsquo;ll describe how we can bridge the
gap to produce a world of universal automation that can (eventually)
extend to all the components in the datacenter - raw hardware,
storage, networking, OSes (Windows AND Linux), application frameworks,
applications, etc.

Traditional security activities that depend on manual penetration tests and application assessments simply cannot keep up with the speed of continuous delivery and devops.  Security testing shares many common aspects with acceptance and quality testing, and by enhancing the existing tools and techniques it is possible to provide continuous security testing at the speed of devops.

Behaviour Driven Development using a 'Given/When/Then' format allows us to write self verifying security specifications in a natural language which are understandable by the whole team.  This talk will present the open source BDD-Security framework which is designed to provide DevOps teams with the tools to:
a) Specify the security requirements in a human readable form
b) Make those same requirements executable tests that can be run against a target application
c) Record and test business logic security vulnerabilities
c) Integrate these tests into continuous delivery environments so that security testing can be performed continuously and on-demand.

The talk will include a live demonstration of configuring and running the BDD-Security framework to test a web application and will also show how to integrate it with the Jenkins CI server so that security tests are run after every new code commit.

Openstack is not only revolutionising the open source cloud world, but also redefining the way massive collaboration efforts are undertaken. This talk will illustrate how the Openstack community can pull this off using commonly available  open source tools, a tight organisation and the collaborative effort of the community. Hopefully, attendees will learn the state-of-the-art in collaborative development (both practises and tools) and will be inspired but the impressive feat of collaboration to translate that very lesson into their daily practises. And perhaps, sparkle more interest in Openstack!

The talk can stretch the full 30 minutes of a slot, but can be condensed in the ignite 5-minute format (focusing on the tooling and their interactions). A version of the talk/ignite can be adapted for the workshop format of day 1 and/or openspace format, with the goal of preparing and submitting a real patch to one of the Openstack project within few hours, using and understanding the community tools.

As a young company, it's fairly easy to stay flexible and adapt quickly. However, as your company grows you become more rigid and it becomes more difficult to change processes and the overall team culture. In our session we'd like to discuss how to build a culture around the alignment of developers, operations, and the executive team. We'll cover the tools, strategy, and philosophy that has proven to enable cultural change in our respective companies. Attendees of this session will leave knowing the specific tools which foster collaboration and a blueprint to take with them to cultivate organizational change.

Inspired by the talk 'Using Rundeck and Chef to build DevOps Toolchains'
given by Anthony Shortland during ChefConf 2012
(http://dev2ops.org/2012/05/using-rundeck-and-chef-to-build-devops-toolchains-at-chefcon/)
we set out to include Rundeck as part of a loosely coupled toolchain
when building the new datacenter at Bol.com. This talk will explore how
we took the ideas from Shortland's talk and implemented them in the
context of Jenkins, Gerrit, Puppet and MCollective.

I will share how we met the challenges of changing configuration with
automatic deployments, needing an easy to use interface for
non-technical users while retaining control and power for the techies.

Due to the scope it will necessarily be a high-level overview but with
just enough detail to demonstrate how all the pieces fit and work together.

Speaker:

spent the last two years building the deployment toolchain while seeing
how far he can push Puppet and gained an appreciation for Ruby in the
process.

Our team at EToro was challenged with creating a Continuous Delivery system that was generic enough to be used by our over 70 different services. An additional complexity is that most of our environment is Windows .NET, but we have Linux systems for Load Balancing, Message Queueing, Big Data and other operations tasks. Dealing with the persistence issues of a Database deployment presents us with additional challenges. An additional complexity is that our environment is highly regulated and access to production systems is restricted. Finally, our architecture, processes and culture needed to change.

Our proposal was to create a Deployment Pipeline using Jenkins, Orchestration via MCollective and custom ruby scripts and Puppet for Configuration Management and Deployment. Having successfully implemented this process, I want to explain how we did it, what were the issues we faced and why we chose the tools we did.

Having worked years on the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) side of things I have a deep knowledge of Jenkins. Many of the people I've talked to on the ALM side did not understand why Jenkins is not enough to deploy from Development to Production. Now living on the Web Operations side of the business I understand that it comes down to Orchestration. A Deployment Pipeline does not do Orchestration. It handles the flow from Dev to Production, but not the complex task of creating zero downtime deployment. Enter MCollective, HAProxy, Puppet, NUnit and friends. By using multiple Load Balancing pools - moving servers between online and maintenance pools we can deploy and test on a portion of servers without bringing down all servers and without exposing these servers to our customers. Once passing our testing phase we can bring the tested servers online and continue with deploying on the rest of the servers.

We used several custom MCollective plugins that interact with HAProxy, and our health check system and created orchestration around MCollective and Puppet using Ruby. And finally tying this all in to the Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins we have a generic, scalable framework for Continuous Delivery.

Monitoring and Logging are also a critical piece for visibility into our process. We use Splunk, Graphite and Nagios for this.

In addition we use pull deployments not push deployments to enable a Continuous Delivery system in our secure environment. MCollective is one of the only tools that can deploy using a Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) paradigm with the help of RabbitMQ.

Finally, none of this could have happened without teamwork. There is a very good reason why DevOps is a cultural revolution. Participation and communication between everyone in the company is what made this possible, from Developers, Operations, QA, Product Management, 'The Business', everyone needed to be bought in to this process. We have not rolled out this process to all our services, but we are off and running.

I began my journey in computers in the Israeli Military as an organizational consultant. With a fresh degree in Psychology I was researching soldier motivation. Using the tools of the trade I started working with SAS statistical analysis tools. I found myself more interested in how to come up with the data than the data itself. I was hooked. When I finished my service, I decided to pursue a career in computers. I took a course at John Bryce Training Center in Database Development and searched for my first job. I landed my first computer job at Ernst &amp; Young working in the implementation of ERP solutions. I worked on the development of the financial localization of Baan software and then worked at a telecommunications company using Oracle Applications. The role included managing the deployment of code and configuration from the Development environment to Production.

After 15 years I am still hooked. I am passionate about Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Cloud Computing. The skills I developed early in my career have helped me both as an individual contributor and a manager.

Today everyone is talking about clouds, and a few are building them, but far fewer are operating successful clouds.  In this session we'll examine a variety of paradigm shifts IT makes when moving from a traditional virtualization and management mindset to operating a successful cloud.  For most organizations, without careful planning the hype of a given cloud solution can quickly overcome its capabilities and pre-existing best practices can combine to create the worst possible cloud scenario -- a cloud which isn't economical to operate, and which is more cumbersome to manage than a traditional virtualization farm.

Key topics covered include:


Successful transition of operational and management paradigm
How the VM density of clouds change Ops
What it means to monitor the network in a cloud environment, at hyper-dense virtualization levels
Preventing storage costs from outpacing the capacity of the cloud



The presentation is vendor, hypervisor and cloud management model neutral, though some technology and implementation decisions will impact the possible cloud management solutions.

We've built an end-2-end monitoring system using Jenkins which runs system tests every 5 mins,
This allows us to know if our service is working from a visitor perspective.

We used only open-source solutions like:
1) Jenkins
2) Selenium
3) Dashing - Dashboard for NOC
4) Graphite - Runtime and availability trends

You can read more about it here:

I have a &ldquo;LEGOOps&rdquo; ignite talk that is a corollary to DevOps, including culture, tools, community. The presentation goes through why implementing automation on core services, establishing patterns, and leveraging &lsquo;service management&rsquo; are all good ideas when looking to implement DevOps within an existing company &ndash; especially an environment that includes legacy infra solutions and is competing with newer methods to deliver IT assets.

If a developer takes the time to write and run unit test cases for his code, his goal is to deliver a better product. So you can ask yourself why we still need testers if all developers are doing unit testing. Because there is no way that a developer is able to come up with all of the test cases to verify when his code will fail. Developers are too attached to their code, and it is emotionally not possible to test the application for bugs.

A solution for this problem is the concept of TDD (Test Driven Development) where you get something working now and perfect this later. So why should testers care about TDD? Mainly because of the main activity within TDD: the creation of a unit test case before writing any 'production' code.

Like stated before the developer will need some help to come up with decent test cases and this will result in a closer and better collaboration between a tester and a developer. A new concept has been born namely Collaboration Driven Development (CDD). In CDD the tester will help the developer during the creation of their unit tests (with standard checklist or with a test condition brainstorm session) and the developers can help the tester understand the application more in detail.

I as a tester, I cringe when I see the crappy code has been shipped before toward the test and the production environment. Nowadays this crappy code is disappearing from the application and when a bug is reported by the testers we all know that is a good bug and not a bug which will go into the bug ping pong lifecycle.

So this presentation will cover the concept of CDD together with the benefits and the disadvantages of this approach in order to show that when a developer take the necessary time to test his code with unit test cases it doesn't mean that a better product is created.

Speaker:

I started my career as a manual test engineer working in a waterfall approach. Since that project I am convinced that working in an iterative modus (agile, lean or &hellip;) is a solution for failing projects. Since 2008 I am a solution architect for software testing in order to help customers in having better quality through an optimization of the different test activities.

I am an agile minded tester and curious how different test approaches can be used within agile environments.
