<h2>Booth Space</h2>

<p>Gold and Platinum Sponsor packages receive dedicated booth space at the event. Your booth space will consist of a table placed prominently in our venue, SFU Harbour Centre, near the Fletcher Challenge theatre. Your table can be used to display your products and materials or swag giveaways. We encourage sponsors to send engineers to interact with attendees during session breaks, and to avoid large displays and heavy marketing materials.</p>

<h2>One-minute Pitch</h2>

<p>Between sessions, Gold Sponsors are given one minute to introduce themselves and their company to the full audience. The emcee will invite a small number to make an introduction during transitions between sessions. In addition to the full audience, your one-minute pitch will be broadcast to the audience watching the live Internet video feed.</p>

<h2>Sponsor FAQ</h2>

<h3>Can you send me a floor plan?</h3>

<p>Yes, we will be sending this out when we have one. The booths for the gold sponsors will be in the Lounge area. The shared swag table for the silver sponsors will also be in the Lounge area. The Platinum sponsor’s table will be at the entrance to the Lounge area.</p>

<h3>How big is our booth space?</h3>

<p>For Gold Sponsors, you will receive a table and two chairs.  Silver sponsors share a swag table where they can lay out printed materials, stickers or other swag.  For silver sponsors, this is a shared table so please be a good neighbour and don’t use up too much of the table.</p>

<h3>When can we pick our booth spot?</h3>

<p>Booths are not selectable. Our team will assign your table. Assignments will be made two weeks from conference date.</p>

<h3>How many scanners (and which type) do we get?</h3>

<p>None. The booth is a place to talk to people during breaks and this conference is not a typical conference or convention. We have seen that sponsors benefit the most when they bring engineers to the conference and interact with the attendees during the sessions--not at the booth. You are responsible to collect any info you want in person if you want to do giveaways. Wednesday at closing session, we will give a time slot for a giveaway.</p>

<h3>Can we bring 1m roll-up as our back wall?</h3>

<p>Whatever you bring must fit behind or on your table. This conference is not about the booth!</p>

<h3>Will we have any chairs are our booth?</h3>

<p>Each booth comes with 2 chairs.</p>

<h3>Will there be a company sign at our booth? When do you need graphics?</h3>

<p>You must bring your own signage and all signage must either fit on the table or behind it.</p>

<h3>Do we get any sponsored talks?</h3>

<p>No, but you are welcome to submit a proposal like everyone else.</p>

<h3>Do we get electricity connection for our booth?</h3>

<p>Yes. You’ll get a power strip.</p>

<h3>Will wifi connection be good enough for showing demos?</h3>

<p>Yes, depending on what’s being demonstrated! If you have particular needs, please let us know that you will be accommodating your own network requirements.</p>

<h3>Do we get an ad in the program? When do you need graphics?</h3>

<p>Send us a URL to your logo. When you do, we’ll download the image, size it appropriately, and include it on our web site.</p>

<h3>Do we get a dedicated email blast?</h3>

<p>No. As a Sponsor, you will be included in the Thank You email at the end of the conference, along with a URL to your landing page.</p>

<h3>Who should I send?</h3>

<p>Not marketing folks! Send your techie geeks that can interact with the attendees during sessions, Open Spaces, and breaks.</p>

<h3>What are the demographics of the attendees?</h3>

<p>Technologists, architects, technology managers.  Refer to the registration list, to be released shortly.</p>
