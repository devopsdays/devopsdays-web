<!-- Scan through a range of years and look in data/events for events during these years.
If found, store year in "active_years" scratch in order to get back to that year later.
Also save the event name under scratch with the ID of the scratch equal to the year number.

Chomping .year has the nice effect of turning an int into string. -->
